         "UT/TT Poll: Texas voters feeling high anxiety over election security",
         "Voters in the party that has not lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994 are most likely to say that elections are fraught with criminality, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.\n\nThe findings echo Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s “rigged election” theme and rising apprehension over foreign or criminal hackers.\n\nRepublicans, who have won every statewide election in Texas for the past two decades, were more likely than independents and much more likely than Democrats to say that “people voting who are not eligible” will be an “extremely serious” or “somewhat serious” problem in this year’s elections.\n\nNine of 10 Republicans said ineligible voters voting would be a serious problem, 69 percent of independents said so and only 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Three-quarters of the Democrats rated the problem “not too serious” or “not serious at all.”\n\nAmong the Republican voters, 70 percent ranked the problem as “extremely serious.”\n\n“Wow,” said Daron Shaw, co-director of the poll and a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, after looking over the results. “To me, it’s an indication of how unhappy people are with the system, how deeply they believe it is corrupt and incompetent.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe same pattern held true when they were asked about people voting multiple times. Overwhelming numbers of Republican likely voters — 83 percent — said that will be a serious problem this year. Among independent voters, 61 percent agreed with that, but only 24 percent of Democrats think multiple voting will be a serious problem.\n\n“This is one of these showcase results where you have to ask the chicken-and-egg question about Republican attitudes in Texas and what Donald Trump seems to have wrought — but might just be plugging into,” said Jim Henson, who heads the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin and co-directs the poll. “Republicans nationally, but also in Texas, have been stoking worries about the election process in the absence of any systematic evidence of any real problems.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe party lines blur a bit when voters are asked about “votes being counted inaccurately.” Three quarters of self-identified Republican and independent voters think that will be a serious concern this year, and 45 percent of Democrats agree with them.\n\nAnd the lines fade more when it comes to “voting machines being hacked into by a foreign government or other bad actor.” That one got a serious ranking from 66 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of independents and 55 percent of Democrats.\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 14 to Oct. 23 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points. Among likely voters — those who said either that they are certain to vote or that they have voted in “every” recent election — the margin of error is +/- 3.16 percentage points (n=959). Numbers in charts might not add up to 100 percent because of rounding.\n\nThis is one of several stories on the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. Yesterday: The race for president. Also today: What Texas voters think about various state and federal officeholders and institutions.\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.

         "Phil Murphy beats Kim Guadagno to succeed Christie as N.J. governor",
         "TRENTON -- Phil Murphy, a former Wall Street executive and diplomat with no previous elected experience but deep pockets and strong ties to the Democratic Party, easily defeated Republican Kim Guadagno Tuesday to succeed Chris Christie as New Jersey's governor.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, with 99 percent of districts reporting, Murphy led Guadagno by about 13 percentage points -- 55.4 percent to 42.5 percent, according to the Associated Press. Murphy was ahead by nearly 250,000 voters -- 1.12 million to 859,000.\n\nCNN, ABC, and NBC projected Murphy the victory around 8 p.m. Tuesday, almost immediately after the polls closed. The projection was based on exit polling and was an indicator the race would not be close.\n\nMurphy's victory over Guadagno, Christie's lieutenant governor, will usher in a new era of Democratic rule in the Garden State after eight years of Christie, a once-popular Republican who saw his approval rating plummet to historic lows in recent years. Christie was prohibited by state law from running for a third consecutive term.\n\nMurphy, 60, will become the first Democrat in the governor's office since Jon Corzine, another former Goldman Sachs executive who spent millions of his own money to win the seat in 2005 but lost re-election to Christie in 2009.\n\nWhen Murphy is sworn in as the state's 56th governor Jan. 16, Democrats will likely control both the governor's office and the state Legislature for the first time since Corzine's four-year term.\n\nAll legislative races have not been called yet, but Democrats will at least hold -- if not expand -- their control of both the state Senate and Assembly.\n\n\"Tonight, we declare the days of division over,\" Murphy said during his victory speech in Asbury Park. \"We will move forward together. ... We have each other's backs.\"\n\nMurphy -- a former U.S. ambassador to Germany -- will take over arguably the most powerful governor's seat in the nation, with the ability to line-item veto bills and the state budget and appoint state officials who are elected in other states.\n\nHe has promised to push New Jersey in a progressive direction, vowing to legalize and tax marijuana, institute a $15 minimum wage, tighten the state's already strict gun-control laws, and ramp up funding for education, public-worker pensions, and transportation, while protecting undocumented immigrants and fighting the agenda of President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nMurphy said Tuesday night that he will push back against \"the mean winds\" blowing out of Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This is one of the first major elections since Donald Trump was elected,\" he said. \"Tonight, New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation: We are better than this.\"\n\nMurphy will also bring a much different personality to the governor's office than Christie did. Whereas Christie made national headlines for his brash, often combative attitude, Murphy is more low-key and prone to smiling even when challenged.\n\nMurphy inherits a state with signifiant problems -- including the highest property taxes in the country, a troubled transportation system, and a public-worker pension system deeply in debt.\n\nFor Guadagno, the loss brings an end to her eight-year run in Trenton. With her association to Christie hanging on her like an albatross, Guadagno trailed Murphy by double digits in every poll and had a 3-to-1 fundraising disadvantage in a state where registered Democrats outnumber register Republicans by about 880,000.\n\nGuadagno, who was vying to become only the second woman governor in state history, lost even though she had cut into Murphy's lead in polls with an aggressive push before Election Day.\n\nGuadagno said during her concession speech that her campaign \"made the best case possible.\"\n\n\"We were fighting for our families and we will continue that fight for lower taxes and a safer New Jersey,\" she told the crowd in Aberdeen. \"This is not the end. ... We may have lost the battle, but we will win this war in the long run.\"\n\nNew Jersey was one of only two states in the U.S. with a governor's election Tuesday, along with Virginia.\n\nAnd though voters in the blue state were getting to choose Christie's replacement a year after Trump's election, the race largely inspired apathy among Jerseyans. Up until last week, polls showed more than half of likely voters knew little about Guadagno or Murphy.\n\nBut a Democrat -- Ralph Northam -- also won Virginia's race. And political experts Tuesday were already framing both elections as a repudiation of Trump's policies.\n\nTuesday's victory caps an unexpected journey to the Statehouse for Murphy, a Boston area native who was little known in the state before entering this race last year.\n\nMurphy gobbled up support from the Democratic Party chairs in key north Jersey counties to become the front-runner for the party's nomination, pushing aside expected candidates like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester.\n\nHe then spent $16 million of his own fortune en route to handily beating five primary opponents to snag the Democratic nomination.\n\nMurphy repeatedly linked Guadagno to Christie and promised to boost the state's economy, saying his time at Goldman Sachs taught him how to create jobs.\n\nGuadagno repeatedly linked Murphy to Corzine, calling him an out-of-touch multimillionaire liberal who would raise taxes in the state.\n\nMurphy plans to increase spending by $1.3 billion on education, pensions, and transportation by hiking taxes on wealthy residents, closing corporate tax loopholes, and taxing legal pot. He says the hikes would spare the middle class.\n\nHe also proposes instituting a state-run bank to help rev the economy.\n\nMurphy vows to battle Trump's policies in a diverse state where the president is deeply unpopular. He said during a debate that he would even consider making New Jersey a \"sanctuary state\" to protect some undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nGuadagno pounced on that, painting Murphy as being too soft on crime and releasing a controversial television ad that suggested he would even protect \"deranged murderers\" like Jose Carranza, an undocumented immigrant from Peru who was convicted of killing thee teens in Newark in 2007.\n\nMurphy and his supporters denounced the commercial as racist and deceitful. Visiting Edison to stump for Murphy, former Vice President Joe Biden called it \"the return of Willie Horton\" -- a reference to the infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race.\n\nPolitical experts said Guadagno appeared to be borrowing a page from Trump's far-right playbook to appeal to the GOP base in what was predicted to be a race with a record-low voter turnout.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nPolls showed that Guadagno was hurt by her connection to Christie, a one-time national Republican star and presidential contender whose approval ratings have dropped by nearly 50 percentage points over the last few years.\n\nAfter voting in Mendham on Tuesday morning, Christie rejected the idea that this race was a referendum on his two terms as governor.\n\n\"This is not an election about me,\" Christie said. \"I had my referendum. My referendum was four years ago.\"\n\nChristie said he voted for @KimGuadagnoNJ, and that he doesn't think 2017 is a referendum on his tenure pic.twitter.com/aBMOPMYVWq — Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017\n\nNew Jerseyans often pinball between electing Republicans and Democrats for governor. No Democratic governor has won re-election since Brendan Byrne did 40 years ago, in 1977.\n\nMurphy overcame his ties to Goldman Sachs, which had become a target of derision during last year's presidential race. He spent 23 years at the Wall Street firm, managing its Asian and German offices.\n\nHe and his wife, Tammy Murphy, donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party both locally and national over the years and he served as the finance chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2006 to 2009.\n\nPresident Barack Obama then chose Murphy to become America's ambassador to Germany, a post Murphy held until 2013.\n\nMurphy was bolstered over the last two months by campaign visits from a string of big-name Democrats -- including Obama, Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Al Gore. Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi, his friend and neighbor, also performed at a Murphy rally two days before Election Day.\n\nMurphy also had the support of dozens of labor unions, including the New Jersey Education Association and the Communication Workers of America.\n\nMurphy's lieutenant governor will be Sheila Oliver, a veteran member of the state Assembly from Essex County who was the first black woman to serve as Assembly speaker in state history.\n\nOliver also won re-election to her Assembly seat on Tuesday. But under state law, she will have to give up that post to serve as lieutenant governor.\n\nNJ Advance Media staff writers Matt Arco and Claude Brodesser-Akner contributed to this report.\n\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.

         "Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks",
         "Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks\n\nAlthough the past few years have been an incredibly powerful time for women’s rights, feminism has just suffered a pretty crushing setback: Tragically, this woman sucks.\n\nDevastating. This is not good news for the feminist cause.\n\nThe notion that all women are powerful queens who deserve the world sadly doesn’t even come close to applying to 28-year-old Sarah Baylor, whose boring hobbies, grating personality traits, and overall lack of positive attributes prove that some women can (and do) absolutely suck. Between the below-average work she does at her totally inconsequential job, the meandering anecdotes about owning a ferret she foists on unsuspecting acquaintances, and the fact that she honestly smells kind of bad, Sarah unfortunately does not bring a single thing to the table that would compel someone to fight for women’s rights on her behalf. It’s tough to imagine anyone getting behind a movement intended to empower someone as unpleasant to be around as this god-awful woman.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s difficult to extend any sisterly support to someone who sucks this much ass.\n\nThere’s no telling how far Sarah will set back the feminist cause over the course of her life, but her apparent commitment to using her bad personality to totally blow every personal and professional opportunity that comes her way suggests that she will continue giving women a bad name for the foreseeable future. Had Sojourner Truth known that one day a woman like Sarah would go through life without ever doing anything even marginally impressive—seriously, not even winning some kind of bogus “citizenship” award in elementary school—would she have bothered to fight for women’s rights in the first place? It’s hard to say.\n\nYikes. We can only imagine what kind of damage Sarah already done to feminism just by being her selfish, slovenly, and frankly horrible self. Here’s hoping the feminist agenda finds a way to prevail despite such an awful blight on the movement.",

There are also indications that the 28-year-old gunman communicated with at least one person who is currently being monitored as a potential terror suspect, the source said.\n\nFarook’s connection to the potential terror suspect may only be tangential, the source said, but the link suggests there may be a “deeper terror matrix” behind the San Bernardino shootings.\n\nBut Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), the ranking minority member of the House Intelligence Committee who has been briefed on the investigation, said Thursday that federal agents have yet to turn up evidence that Farook was “radicalized.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarook and Malik fired at least 65 shots when they stormed the conference room at the Inland Regional Center, where 75 to 80 people had gathered for a holiday potluck. Twelve of the 14 dead and 18 of the 21 injured were county employees, police said.\n\nHours later, they exchanged fire with police on San Bernardino streets, launching bullets into homes and terrifying residents.\n\nWhen they searched Farook and Malik’s home, police recovered a dozen pipe bombs, 2,000 9-millimeter handgun rounds, 2,500 .223-caliber assault rifle rounds and “hundreds of tools” that could have been used to make additional explosive devices, Burguan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the attack on the party, Farook and Malik used two assault rifles and two semiautomatic handguns, all of which were purchased legally, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nAs authorities continued to look into the backgrounds of the husband and wife responsible for America’s deadliest mass shooting since 2012, investigators and legislators from California to Washington, D.C., tried to understand what motivated the shooters.\n\nPolice have also said that Farook was involved in a dispute at the party for fellow employees of the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health shortly before the gunfire broke out.\n\n“We do know that the two individuals who were killed were equipped with weapons and appeared to have access to additional weaponry at their homes,” President Obama said Thursday. “But we don’t know why they did it. We don’t know at this point the extent of their plans. We do not know their motivations.”\n\nSchiff echoed those sentiments.\n\n“They’re not ready to draw conclusions, but looking at anyone they were involved with that could shed light on what their motivations were,” he said. “The FBI is chasing down leads foreign and domestic, and looking for any evidence of radicalization.”\n\nSan Bernardino shooting × On Now Inside the home of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik On Now Video: San Bernardino honors shooting victims at stadium vigil On Now Farook family lawyers discuss FBI's comments about attacker's Facebook post On Now FBI: San Bernardino shooting investigated as act of terrorism On Now San Bernardino resident expresses sorrow for victims On Now People attend vigil for shooting victims at San Manuel Stadium in San Bernardino On Now Inside a gun shop on the day of the shootings On Now What happened in San Bernardino, a timeline On Now Backlash against neighbor of San Bernardino shooters On Now Mothers talk about children's safety during San Bernardino shooting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a news conference Thursday, Burguan said the suspects had 1,400 assault rifle rounds and 200 handgun rounds in their car as they fled from police. The couple fired 76 rounds at officers during the shootout, and officers shot 380 rounds in return. Burguan said he believed the suspects shot first.\n\nDespite uncertainty about the motive, Burguan said the cache of weapons and ammunition found at the couple’s home suggests the shootings were preplanned.\n\nOne law enforcement source said investigators are trying to determine whether explosives left at the scene of the shooting were from a design found in Inspire magazine, the online publication of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The source noted that the design is easily accessible and doesn’t mean the attack was related to Al Qaeda. Police said the device included three pipe bombs attached to a remote-controlled device.\n\nFarook was born in Illinois, and had worked at the Health Department as an inspector for five years. Malik was born in Pakistan, according to a federal law enforcement source.\n\nFarook traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2013 during the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and also visited Saudi Arabia in July 2014 for nine days to pick up Malik and bring her to the United States on a K-1 fiance visa. Neither trip lasted very long, the official said. The official has seen no record of Farook traveling to Pakistan, as the assistant director for the FBI’s Los Angeles field office said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nFarook’s foreign travel didn’t raise the usual alarm bells with federal agencies because he didn’t spend several months overseas or travel to places where he could have spent a long period of time in a jihadist training camp, a senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalik applied for permanent residency on Sept. 30, 2014, and, after a background check by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, received a permanent resident green card in July 2015. The Saudi embassy in Washington had no records indicating that Malik was a Saudi citizen.\n\nPolice said they believe Farook and Malik were the only people directly involved in the shooting, but said the investigation was continuing.\n\nFederal investigators were attempting to interview three men who “were in phone contact” with Farook and his wife in the days leading up to the shooting rampage, a government official said.\n\nOne of the men that federal officials wanted to interview was Roshan Zamir Abbassi, who was born in Pakistan, according to a government source.\n\nAbbassi is an assistant imam at the Dal-Al-Uloom Al-Islamiyah of America mosque in San Bernardino, where Farook had regularly worshipped. Abbassi said he barely knew Farook, sharing only occasional hellos and goodbyes with him after prayers. Abbassi said he didn’t know Farook’s wife at all.\n\nAbbassi said he was confronted at gunpoint while at home Wednesday night by three officers, one of whom had a badge identifying him as a U.S. Secret Service agent, and was told they had phone records showing that Abbassi had been in contact with Farook at least 36 times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“But each of those could have been for only 10 seconds,” Abbassi told The Times on Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn fact, when Farook’s name surfaced as the alleged shooter, Abbassi said he didn’t initially recognize it, because he only knew Farook by his middle name, Rizwan.\n\nAbbassi posted a message about his run-in with the police Wednesday night on his Facebook page. Prior to that, the most recent item he shared was a video by Canadian poet Boona Mohammed condemning ISIS terrorism, but arguing that Western nations are equally guilty of attempting to achieve political and religious goals through violence, intimidation and fear.\n\n“I’m just condemning all forms of terrorism, whether it comes from someone with a Muslim background, or someone with a Christian background who shoots up an abortion clinic,” Abbassi said. The police did not ask about the views expressed in his social media feed, Abbassi said.\n\nAfter searching him to make sure he was unarmed, the officers holstered their weapons and questioned him for about an hour, Abbassi said.\n\nHe was not arrested or told he would be charged with a crime, Abbassi said.\n\nAbbassi said he is an American citizen, but was not born in the U.S. His parents brought him to this country when he was younger than 2 years old. Asked were his parents came from, he said, “I prefer to keep that private.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We are all against terrorism,” Abbassi said. “We all want peace.”\n\nOn Thursday morning, FBI agents and SWAT officers also raided a condominium in Corona, where they led away one man in handcuffs, neighbors said.\n\n“FBI agents with bullhorns showed up at 5 a.m.,” said Lorraine Otto, who lives next door to the home on Forum Way. “They kept saying, ‘This is the FBI. Open the door. If you don’t open the door, we’ll break it open.’”\n\nA federal law enforcement source told The Times that while investigators have yet to establish a clear motive in the shooting, they are leaning toward a possible “combination of terrorism and workplace” conflict.\n\nInvestigators also believe the couple had a familiarity with weapons and military-style tactics.\n\n“We want to know how they acquired that,” the source said.\n\nFarook and Malik were not known to federal investigators prior to the attack, the source said.\n\nShortly before the shooting, the couple left their young daughter with the child’s grandmother in Redlands, saying they had a doctor’s appointment, according to Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey headed to the regional center soon after.\n\nThe grandmother grew panicked when news of the shooting broke and began frantically calling Farook and Malik, but they did not answer, Ayloush said.\n\nFourteen people, all of them California residents, were killed in the gunfire.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Coroner’s office identified the slain victims late Thursday as: Shannon Johnson, 45, of Los Angeles; Bennetta Betbadal, 46, of Rialto; Aurora Godoy, 26, of San Jacinto; Issac Amanios, 60, of Fontana; Larry David Kaufman, 42, of Rialto; Harry Bowman, 46, of Upland; Yvette Velasco, 27, of Fontana; Sierra Clayborn, 27, of Moreno Valley; Robert Adams, 40, of Yucaipa; Nicholas Thalasinos, 52, of Colton; Tin Nguyen, 31, of Santa Ana; Juan Espinoza, 50, of Highland; Damian Meins, 58, of Riverside; and Michael Wetzel, 37, of Lake Arrowhead.\n\nThe shooting reignited the national debate over gun control. The president said Thursday that it was still too easy for people who want to kill large numbers of people to get access to high-powered weapons in the U.S.\n\n“We’re going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society to make sure that we can take basic steps that would make it harder, not impossible, but harder for individuals to get access to weapons,” Obama said.\n\nFarook and Malik used a pair of .223-caliber assault rifles and two semiautomatic handguns in the shooting, Burguan said.\n\nA federal law enforcement source told The Times that Farook purchased the pistols at Annie’s Get Your Gun, a firearms retailer in Corona that advertises itself as a “family-friendly gun store.” The source added that the two rifles used in the attack were purchased at a second store by a person they believed to be Farook’s former roommate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman reached by phone at Annie’s Get Your Gun, who identified herself as Anne, the store owner, denied that the weapons involved in the shooting were sold at her store.\n\n“That’s not true,” she said, before hanging up.\n\nRelatives of the victims on Thursday were still reeling from the shootings.\n\nJulie Swann-Paez, an inspector with the Health Department, was supposed to receive an employee of the year award at the party, according to relatives. But she was shot twice when Farook and Malik stormed the conference room. She suffered a shattered pelvis and other serious injuries.\n\n“Love you guys,” she said in a group text message to her family. “Was shot.”\n\nHer son, 26-year-old Nick Paez, didn’t see the message until at least an hour after the shooting, and raced to the hospital unsure of his mother’s condition.\n\n“I thought she was dead,” he said as he sat in his parents’ home with his younger brother and sister on Thursday. Photos of the family filled the small room.\n\nSwann-Paez’s loved ones weren’t allowed to visit her until 10 p.m. Nick Paez said he told his mother that her co-worker, Farook, may have been the shooter.\n\n“That doesn’t make sense,” Swann-Paez said, according to her son. “They were congratulating him for having a baby.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor others, the torturous wait for information ended in sorrow. Ryan Reyes said he dropped off his boyfriend, Kaufman, who went by his middle name, Daniel, at 7 a.m. at the regional center, where he managed the coffee shop.\n\nThey traded cheerful texts throughout the morning. But at 10:37 a.m., Reyes received an ominous message from his sister.\n\n“Hey Ry does Daniel work at the Regional Center in Sb?” the message read. “Check the news.”\n\nReyes, 32, called his boyfriend repeatedly but kept getting sent to voicemail.\n\n“Call me ASAP!” he texted. There was no reply.\n\nThe next 22 hours were agonizing, as Reyes and his family received conflicting reports about Kaufman’s fate.\n\nReyes’ cellphone rang again Thursday morning. It was another call from a relative, this time confirming the news he had been dreading.\n\nKaufman was dead.\n\nTimes staff writers James Queally, Sarah Parvini, Joseph Serna, Rong-Gong Lin II, Veronica Rocha and Louis Sahagun contributed to this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow @JamesQueallyLAT on Twitter for breaking news.\n\nMORE ON SAN BERNARDINO\n\nHow the massacre in San Bernardino set off a surreal day for hundreds\n\nSuspects dropped off baby before San Bernardino shooting rampage\n\nSan Bernardino shooting suspect endured turbulent home life, according to court documents",

         "In the last 24 hours, four federal courts have objected to Trump’s actions",
         "Last night, a Federal District court issued an emergency stay on deportations for passengers affected by President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. Since that first decision, three other courts have issued their own rulings, putting a halt to deportations for those detained at airports across the country.\n\nDespite the rulings, there appears to be some uncertainty surrounding the judicial orders. The New York Post reports that some customs agents have ignored the orders, and have not allowed access to detainees. We’ll update this report as more information becomes available.\n\nTrump’s team now appears to be tweaking the executive order in response to widespread protests. Late on Sunday night, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a waiver that allows people holding green cards or with valid permanent residence in the United States to enter the country. In a statement published on the DHS’ site, Kelly said that “in applying the provisions of the president’s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.” The statement says that “absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”\n\nHere’s where we stand:\n\nNew York City\n\nFederal Judge Ann Donnelly noted in her decision that that “there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject,” impacted by the order. The order was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a pair of Iraqi refugees who had been detained.\n\nThe order only applies to individuals who had been detained at airports around the country: that is, people who had come from one of the nations that were banned in the executive order.\n\nThe decision has no impact on the rest of the order, which bans citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya from entering the United States for the next 90 days, bans refugees from those countries for 120 days, and bans refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nAlexandria, Virginia\n\nFederal Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a ruling last night as well for 50 to 60 individuals from the affected countries who are Lawful Permanent Residents. According to petitioners, the people detained were denied access to lawyers, and that removing them from the country would result in “irreparable harm.”\n\nBrinkema agreed, ordering that the detained individuals be granted access to legal counsel, and forbid them from being deported for the next seven days.\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nIn Seattle, members of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed for an Emergency Stay of Removal on behalf of two individuals, saying that the detentions were illegal. District Court Judge Thomas Thomas S. Zilly ordered the stay of removal, “pending further order of the court.” He also set a hearing for Friday, February 3rd to determine whether or not to lift the stay.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nFinally, petitioners filed a petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive relief with the federal court overnight in Boston, Massachusetts. US District Judge Allison D. Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Gail Dein found that the detention and removal of “the petitioners and others similarly situated would violate their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection as guaranteed by the United States Constitution,” and that should the detained individuals be removed from the US, they would likely “suffer irreparable harm.”\n\nThe judges ordered that the Department of Homeland Security would be required to limit “secondary screening to comply with the regulations and statutes in effect prior to the Executive Order,” were not permitted to “detain or remove” approved refugees, anyone who held a valid Visa, green card holders, and other individuals “who, absent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.” The ruling stipulated that the United States Marshall of Massachusetts would be served with the order and required to enforce it, and that Border Patrol and Customs should notify airlines arriving at Boston’s Logan Airport of the order and that individuals on the flights would not be detained or deported. The judges noted that this ruling would remain in effect for seven days, with another hearing scheduled before then.\n\nThe four rulings represent a setback for the Trump administration, which was acting on campaign promises to halt the flow of refugees and immigrants to the United States, and were accompanied by widespread protests last night, with more planned in the coming days.\n\nFollowing the rulings, the American Civil Liberties Union has promised to continue to fight against the executive orders. “This is merely the first skirmish in a long battle to vigorously defend the Bill of Rights from the authoritarian designs of the Trump administration.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement this morning that it would “comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump’s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.”\n\nThis morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that the country needed extreme vetting, and pointed to immigration in Europe. He also defended his administration decision to provide preferential treatment to minority Christians attempting to enter the United States, noting that they were “executed in large numbers.”\n\nThis morning, The New York Times reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said that green card holders will be permitted to enter the country, but that they would have “discretionary authority” to detain and question individuals.\n\nUpdated to add information from The New York Times and details of John Kelly’s statement.\n\nTrump’s ‘Muslim ban’ won’t help security",

         "Health officials find first cases of new superbug in US",
         "Just five months after federal health officials asked hospitals and physicians to be on the lookout for an often-fatal, antibiotic-resistant fungus called Candida auris, 13 cases have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. It is the first time that the fungus, which is easily misidentified in lab tests as a more common candida yeast infection, has been found in the US, and four of the first seven patients with it have died.\n\n“We need to act now to better understand, contain and stop the spread of this drug-resistant fungus,” the CDC’s director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said in a statement. “This is an emerging threat, and we need to protect vulnerable patients and others.”\n\nC. auris’s emergence and apparent global spread — it was first identified in Japan in 2009 and since then has been found in a dozen countries on four continents — put the pathogen on the ever-growing list of superbugs, disease-causing microbes that are resistant to many and, in some cases, all antibiotics.\n\nRead more: Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nMore From Stat News Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nThe first seven cases, which are described in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, occurred in New York, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey in 2013 (one case), 2015 (one case), and this year (five cases). The older cases were identified through a review of patients’ lab records conducted after the CDC sent its clinical alert in June. All seven of the patients had been hospitalized for cancer, respiratory failure, or other serious condition, so it is not clear if C. auris contributed to the deaths of four of them, the CDC said.\n\nThe other six cases came to the CDC’s attention after August.\n\nFive of the first seven cases had not been flagged as C. auris at the time the patients were hospitalized, underlining the difficulty of identifying the fungus. Five were also resistant to the common antifungal drug fluconazole (sold as Diflucan). One was resistant to amphotericin B, an antifungal usually saved for serious infections, and one to echinocandins, a newer class of antifungals touted as being effective against Candida.\n\nAlthough C. auris strains from other countries have been found to be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs, none of the US cases was.\n\nThe global spread of C. auris has had public health officials on alert for imported cases, but all of the US cases seem to have been contracted domestically. When scientists sequenced the genomes of C. auris in the first seven cases, they found that they were related to strains from South Asia and South America. Since none of the patients had traveled to those areas or were known to have been in contact with anyone from there, CDC scientists concluded that they had acquired the infections locally.\n\n“It appears that C. auris arrived in the United States only in the past few years,” Dr. Tom Chiller, who leads CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch, said in a statement. “We’re working hard with partners to better understand this fungus and how it spreads.”\n\nA partial answer: easily. After one of the Illinois patients was hospitalized for an unrelated illness, researchers found C. auris in his mattress, bedside table, bed rail, chair, and windowsill.\n\nMore evidence of how easy C. auris is spread, at least in hospitals: The genome sequencing showed that the two patients treated in the same New Jersey hospital at the same time had nearly identical strains; the genome sequences of the C. auris infecting the two Illinois patients, also treated at the same hospital at the same time, were also nearly identical to one another. “These findings suggest that C. auris could be spread in healthcare settings,” the CDC said.\n\nAlthough 60 percent of people with C. auris infections outside the US have died, the CDC said, that figure is based on a small number of patients, many of whom had other severe illnesses, making it unclear how serious the infection on its own might be.",

         "Resistance Win: When One Of Her Students Wore A MAGA Hat To Class, This Incredible Teacher Stopped Having Sex With Him After School\n\nFair warning to all you Drumpf lovers out there: You might want to keep scrolling past this story, because a Resistance smackdown this epic may be too much for you to handle: A student in this Toledo, OH high school wore a MAGA hat to class, and his incredible teacher’s amazing response was to completely stop having sex with him every day after school.\n\nAbsolutely perfect. Now THIS is how you secure a W for the right side of history!\n\nAs soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls. Yep, this teacher is the kind of heroic lover of freedom who simply refuses to have an affair with any student of hers who supports Trump’s despicable administration.\n\nHow’s that burn feel, Drumpf lovers??\n\nSo. Epic. It’s not always easy to take a stand in a world where bigotry of all kinds has become the norm since Treasonous Trump took the reins, so it’s absolutely thrilling when someone like Amanda Higgins claps back by telling her Trump-supporting student that she’ll no longer be having sex with him in her car after he’s done with wrestling practice. That 15-year-old MAGA shithead just found out the hard way that actions have consequences.\n\nMs. Higgins, we salute you! The Resistance believes that you deserve to be having sex with a student who believes in freedom and equality for all—not a hateful and bigoted Trump supporter like Eric. Let this be a warning shot to all you Dump lovers out there: If you support this corrupt administration, your days are as numbered as the president’s, because there are plenty more badass takedowns like this on the horizon!",

         "PBS and WETA Announce Groundbreaking Documentary Series ASIAN AMERICANS",
         "To Premiere May 2020 on PBS stations\n\nThe most ambitious television chronicle of the Asian American story\n\nin the United States will launch during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month\n\nBeverly Hills, CA; July 29, 2019 – Today at the Television Critics Association Press Tour, PBS and WETA announced ASIAN AMERICANS, a new five-part documentary series currently in production and expected to broadcast in May 2020 on PBS. The series examines what the 2010 U.S. Census identifies as the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States. Told through individual lives and personal histories, ASIAN AMERICANS explores the impact of this group on the country’s past, present, and future.\n\nLed by a team of Asian American filmmakers, including Academy Award®-nominated series producer Renee Tajima-Peña (Who Killed Vincent Chin?, No Más Bebés), ASIAN AMERICANS examines the significant role of Asian Americans in shaping American history and identity, from the first wave of Asian immigrants in the 1850s and identity politics during the social and cultural turmoil of the twentieth century to modern refugee crises in a globally connected world.\n\n“As America’s home for documentaries, PBS is committed to telling stories that illuminate and celebrate the rich diversity of our country,” said Paula Kerger, PBS President and CEO. “We are proud to share this important series with our audiences, and to deepen understanding about the extraordinary impact of Asian Americans on our national identity.”\n\n“ASIAN AMERICANS is a comprehensive multiplatform initiative that will embrace the question of what it means to be an American,” said Sharon Percy Rockefeller, President and CEO of WETA. “Following our previous series, The Jewish Americans, The Italian Americans and Latino Americans, WETA remains committed to revealing the significant stories of the entire American people.”\n\n“We are proud to support the Center for Asian American Media for the important work they do bringing programs about the Asian American experience to public media and audiences across the country,” said Pat Harrison, CPB president and CEO. “CPB is committed to supporting diverse content for and about people of all backgrounds, and ASIAN AMERICANS is a powerful example of our mission.”\n\n“We are proud to have WETA as a partner on this milestone series, which weaves the histories of many Asian American communities within the broad sweep of American history,” said Stephen Gong, Executive Director of the Center for Asian American Media. “These are American stories: stories of resilience in the face of racism, of overcoming challenges as refugees from war and strife, of making contributions in all sectors of society: business, technology, military service, and the arts. These Asian American experiences and voices provide a vital foundation for a future fast approaching, in which no single ethnic or racial group defines America, in which shared principles will define who we are as Americans.”\n\nAccompanied by robust educational, engagement, and digital components, this groundbreaking initiative will bring a new perspective to the American experience. Partnering with Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles, the series will aim to expand audience reach and engage diverse perspectives through targeted community events, impactful education initiatives and integrated digital content.\n\nASIAN AMERICANS is a production of WETA Washington, DC and the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM) for PBS, in association with the Independent Television Service (ITVS), Flash Cuts and Tajima-Peña Productions. The series executive producers are Jeff Bieber and Dalton Delan for WETA; Stephen Gong and Donald Young for CAAM; Sally Jo Fifer for ITVS; and Jean Tsien. The series producer is Renee Tajima-Peña. The producer for Flash Cuts is Eurie Chung. The episode producers are S. Leo Chiang, Geeta Gandbhir and Grace Lee. The consulting producer is Mark Jonathan Harris.\n\nMajor funding for ASIAN AMERICANS is provided by Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), Wallace H. Coulter Foundation, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), Ford Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, The Freeman Foundation, The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Kay Family Foundation, Long Family Foundation, Spring Wang and Cal Humanities.\n\nFor more information, please visit pbs.org.

         "NEW YORK—In a move touted as a major victory for the rights of New Yorker public transportation passengers who are this close to fucking losing it, the Metropolitan Transit Authority unveiled a new designated seating system Friday designed to accommodate commuters who seem to be just about to snap. “For too many years, the New York City MTA has failed to meet the needs of scowling riders repeatedly muttering ‘Fuck this shit’ under their breath, but today, we’re excited to announce that individuals about to blow a fuse will now be offered seats where they can have a second of goddamn peace,” said spokesman Aaron Donovan, adding that the initiative would cater to the roughly 1.7 million city residents who find themselves on the brink of daily violent meltdowns by adding a minimum of four seating options by the entrance of each subway car, rail car, and bus. “Those seats reserved for customers one bad moment away from flipping their wig at any second will have signage indicating them as such. Those who are clearly going through some serious shit and wearing an expression conveying ‘Not today’ have long been overlooked, so, as always, offer your seat to the critically cranked-up when at all possible.” Shortly after their introduction, thousands of transit passengers across New York City were seen going totally fucking apeshit upon discovering the priority seats already occupied.",

         "One Video Game Company Has Murky Ties To Trump’s Lawyer And Russian Payments",
         "Photo: Alexey Filippov (Host Photo Agency via Getty Images)\n\nRobert Mueller’s investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken all sorts of strange turns over the past year and a half, but this might be one of the strangest: It turns out that Trump’s lawyer has a circuitous connection to the video game company behind games like H1Z1 and Everquest.\n\n\n\nLast night, word came out that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, had received $500,000 in payments from a U.S. investment firm connected to a Russian oligarch named Viktor Vekselberg. That firm, Columbus Nova, has its fingers in a lot of pots. In January 2016, months before a wrestler’s lawsuit led to Kotaku’s former parent company Gawker Media getting purchased by Univision, Columbus Nova put a minority investment into Gawker. And in 2015, it was reported that Columbus Nova purchased Sony Online Entertainment, the San Diego, CA-based studio behind dozens of well-received video games. We knew that because both companies announced it together, with a press release declaring, “Columbus Nova acquires Sony Online Entertainment.” Alongside the move, the company said it would be changing its name to Daybreak.\n\n\n\nNow, Daybreak is rewriting history. Over the past few weeks, as the studio laid off staff amidst a declining audience for H1Z1, Daybreak has distanced itself from Columbus Nova, deleting said press release from its website and telling reporters that it had not actually been purchased by the investment firm, but in fact by businessman Jason Epstein. “Daybreak Game Company has no affiliation with Columbus Nova,” the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement on April 25. “Jason Epstein purchased Daybreak (then SOE) from Sony in February 2015. Mr. Epstein was a senior partner at Columbus Nova at the time he acquired the company. He left Columbus Nova in 2017 and remains the primary shareholder of Daybreak.”\n\nThat statement contradicts much of the company’s past three years, however. Daybreak described Columbus Nova as its parent company in its 2015 user privacy policy, as well as in a press release by Fenwick and West, the law firm that represented SOE in the acquisition. A spokesperson for Daybreak Games would not comment on how the press release could have been so misleading and why no subsequent statements that Columbus Nova owned the company were never corrected before now. Instead, Daybreak elaborated on its initial statement in a forum post, saying it was well aware of past statements made about the company’s ownership but that Epstein had been the majority owner since the acquisition. Daybreak’s spokespeople added that recent changes to the company’s website and third-party communications were simply part of a new effort to set the record straight.\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Daybreakgames.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuestions over Daybreak’s relationship to Columbus Nova began to bubble up in April, when the website MassivelyOP pointed out that the U.S. government had frozen some of Viktor Vekselberg’s assets, which it believed raised questions about the future of games like Everquest II. Vekselberg, a Russian businessman whose net worth in 2015 was reportedly $13.5 billion, is the owner of a company called Renova Group. Until this week, it was widely reported and believed that Columbus Nova was a subsidiary of Renova Group—something that Columbus Nova now denies. Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, has been the CEO of Columbus Nova since 2000 according to his bio on the investment firm’s website, a page which was removed sometime in the last 24 hours. And yesterday, Columbus Nova put out a statement denying that it was owned by Renova Group. “Throughout its existence, Columbus Nova has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients,” the statement reads. “Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group.”\n\n\n\nBoth Vekselberg and Intrater have donated to Trump and both attended his inauguration, according to The New York Times, which also reports that both men have since been interviewed by special prosecutor Bob Mueller’s office, the team in charge of investigating Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nSo here we are. Until April, everyone had believed that Columbus Nova owned Daybreak, which Daybreak now denies. Until this week, everyone had believed that Renova Group owned Columbus Nova—SEC filings even showed as much—which Columbus Nova now denies. And yesterday, news broke that Trump’s lawyer had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late April, as Daybreak was telling press that it was not actually owned by Columbus Nova, the game studio was also laying off staff. Laura Naviaux Sturr, chief publishing officer at Daybreak following the acquisition, left the company on April 25. A day later, many designers and programmers at Daybreak announced on Twitter that they had been let go.\n\nOne of the people laid off, an employee who had been at the company for over six years and asked not to be named, told Kotaku in an email that rumors of the layoffs had been circulating around the office for months and that some people had already cleared out their desks ahead of the official announcement. The employee, who was in a management role, said Epstein owning the company came as a surprise. “Most of us were just as confused by the statement as everyone else was,” they said. “I guess a select few people knew we weren’t actually owned by Columbus Nova, but they were definitely in the minority.”\n\nScreenshot: Daybreak Games (H1Z1)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former creative lead on Planetside 2, who also wished to remain anonymous, shared a similar story. “My understanding at the time was that we were being added to a holding company for Russian investments in tech which was run by Jason,” they told Kotaku. “There was an all-hands meeting shortly before I left where Jason introduced himself, explained who Columbus Nova and Renova were.” While their understanding was that Jason ran Columbus Nova, but was not acquiring the studio himself, they say the distinction was never really made explicit one way or the other.\n\n\n\nThat person left the company shortly after it was sold and after a large round of layoffs. Months later, studio president John Smedley, who had founded the company, left as well. (In the original press release about the sale, Smedley was attributed to the quote: “We are excited to join Columbus Nova’s impressive roster of companies.” Smedley did not respond to a request for comment.) He was replaced by Ji Ham, a vice president at Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAnd what of Columbus Nova’s ties to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and his company, Renova? Despite Columbus Nova’s denials, the web is full of bread crumbs linking the two companies. For example, while Jason Epstein’s profile on the Columbus Nova MB website no longer exists, an archived version of what appeared in September of 2016 lists him as a managing partner of Renova US Management, the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur own connections to Columbus Nova are also tied to Renova. For a period of time between January of 2016 and when Univision bought Gawker the following August, Jason Epstein was given a seat on Gawker’s board of directors. “My understanding at the time of the Columbus Nova investment in Gawker Media in January 2016 was that Columbus Nova was ultimately controlled by Viktor Vekselberg,” John Cook, who was then executive editor of Gawker Media, told me today. Columbus Nova was commonly understood to be the U.S. operating arm of the Russian conglomerate and ultimately owned by Vekselberg, something reiterated in multiple news reports at the time. At the same time, Cook said neither Vekselberg nor anyone at Columbus Nova attempted to exercise any influence over editorial matters during that time.\n\n\n\nMorale at Daybreak remains low, according to the source who was laid off from the studio two weeks ago. They told me that, based on conversations with people still at Daybreak, the atmosphere is grim, despite ongoing company-wide meetings to try and allay people’s concerns about the future of the company. As Daybreak prepares for the PS4 release of H1Z1, whose open beta will launch on May 22, its murky ties to Trump and the Russian investigation cannot be of much comfort.\n\n\n\nUpdate - 5:57pm: Updated the language in the second paragraph to clarify that while Columbus Nova’s acquisition of Daybreak was noted in a press release, it was otherwise not confirmed.",

         "Former stripper who filmed lovers seeks pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens",
         "CLAYTON • A former law student and male stripper prosecuted for invasion of privacy for secretly filming sex partners two decades ago is now seeking a pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, indicted under the same criminal statute last week.\n\nA letter sent Sunday to a lawyer for Greitens cites Greitens’ own motion to dismiss his case and his “published position on this statute,” and requests that the lawyer forward the request.\n\nThe pardon application was submitted to former Gov. Jay Nixon in 2011. He did not grant it or reject it, leaving it pending, the letter says.\n\nThe pardon request, sent by lawyer Albert Watkins, is on behalf of Paul Henreid, of Walnut Creek, Calif., who is a documentary filmmaker and lawyer.\n\nWatkins, who has never shied from publicity or controversy, said in a news release that it would be “mighty hypocritical” for Greitens to reject the request given Greitens’ dismissal motion.\n\n“What’s good for the governor should be good for the gander,” Watkins said.\n\nWatkins also represents the ex-husband of the woman with whom Greitens had an affair. Thursday’s indictment claims Greitens photographed her nude or partially nude without her consent and then transmitted that photograph in some unspecified way.\n\nThe governor’s motion to dismiss does not challenge the existence of a photo, but says the woman had no expectation of privacy, which is a requirement of the invasion of privacy statute, during a consensual sexual encounter.\n\nAudio: Woman describes encounter with Greitens A man says he recorded his then-wife describing an encounter with Eric Greitens in March 2015. The recording, obtained by the Post-Dispatch, w…\n\nIn a taped conversation with her husband, the woman said the governor took the photo without her consent during a consensual sexual encounter, then threatened to release it if she mentioned his name. Greitens has denied blackmailing the woman.\n\nThe scandal has prompted calls for Greitens’ resignation, as well as an independent investigation by legislators.\n\nHis lawyers lashed out at the indictment, and Greitens, a Republican, called it a “misguided political decision” by a “reckless liberal prosecutor” in a statement.\n\nLovers secretly filmed\n\nHenreid, then Paul Henroid, pleaded guilty to invasion of privacy in 1999 after he was caught filming multiple lovers without their knowledge.\n\nOne was a co-worker at the Metro East nightclub where Henroid “moonlighted as an exotic dancer,” the pardon application says. The filming was outed in 1997 by Henroid’s friend, who was also a rival for the woman’s affections, the application says.\n\nHenroid was indicted in 1998 on four counts: invasion of privacy, promoting child pornography, possession of child porn and child abuse. The child porn and abuse charges came because she was 17 at the time of the filming. Although she could legally consent to sex, it was illegal to film her fully or partially nude, the pardon application says.\n\nHenroid’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the invasion of privacy statute as unconstitutionally vague and, foreshadowing Greitens’ own challenge 20 years later, as aimed at “peeping Toms,” not someone engaged in consensual sex, the application says. Henroid then pleaded guilty to the invasion of privacy charge as part of a deal that resulted in the dismissal of the other charges.\n\nHe expected a type of probation that would erase the conviction from the public record, but the judge disagreed. She sentenced him to 30 days of shock time and left him with a conviction, saying he shouldn’t be allowed to be a lawyer “because you have shown no regard for that law or the rights of others,” according to a transcript of the hearing. He was ordered to spend the 30 nights in jail but was allowed out during the day to work.\n\nHenreid is considering running for public office, the application says. He admits that his actions were “deceitful and immoral,” but says the punishment he has suffered and continues to suffer “is unwarranted based on the facts of this case.”\n\nGreitens’ lawyers couldn’t be immediately reached for comment Sunday.",

         "‘When I’m Onstage Performing, There Can Be Up To A Dozen Confused Birds Flapping Around The Ceiling And I Hardly Notice Them At All’: 5 Questions With Janelle Monáe\n\nJanelle Monáe first made her mark in the music world in 2010 with her critically acclaimed debut album, The ArchAndroid, and her incredible artistry and vision have garnered six Grammy nominations since. Monáe has also brought her powerful storytelling abilities to the big screen with roles in two beloved recent films: Hidden Figures and Moonlight. We sat down with the entertainer to talk about her work as an actress, her political activism, and how she produced her most recent studio album.\n\n1. You were signed to Bad Boy Records for the bulk of your career until leaving in 2015. What was your experience with the Diddy-run label like?\n\nIt was definitely a little frustrating. Back when I signed in 2007, it felt like the label was still searching for the artist who would fill The Notorious B.I.G.’s shoes, and at times it seemed like they were hoping it’d be me. Diddy was always interrupting my recording sessions to say things like, “Please, please be mean to Tupac in the next part of this song,” or, “I’m begging you to call Tupac a bald little bitch during the chorus this time. We really need this.” It started to get in the way of my creative process when Diddy would pull me aside and say, “The way Tupac wore his bandana kind of looks like a big Christmas bow—maybe you could do something with that.” Eventually, I got tired of being at a label that couldn’t grow beyond the Biggie vs. Tupac days, so I had to leave.\n\n2. You enlisted the help of The Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson on your new album, Dirty Computer. Was it hard to get him on board?\n\nIt was difficult at first because he didn’t really seem to get what I was going for musically, but once I began breaking things down in a way that was more in his wheelhouse, he was incredible. The breakthrough happened when I came up with a few simple analogies and instructions that he could understand, like “Imagine the microphone is a surfboard and I’m the blonde babe who’s surfing on it in one of those old-ass striped one-piece bathing suits,” or, “I want the production of this song to sound nothing like what you imagine seaweed to sound like underwater,” or, “Sing these lyrics, but mention being buried in sand as little as possible while you do it.” Those analogies did wonders in getting us on the same page. The guy is a legend, and I was happy we could find a way to work together.\n\n3. For you, what’s the main difference between performing as a singer and performing as an actor?\n\nWhen I’m acting, if two birds somehow find their way indoors and fly right in front of the camera it can be enough to completely ruin an entire take. But when I’m performing to a capacity crowd in a huge music venue, there can be up to a dozen confused birds flapping around the ceiling and I hardly notice them at all.\n\n4. You’ve been known to wear tuxedos both onstage and off. How did you develop that personal uniform?\n\nI think tuxedos are the ideal clothing item because they’re so versatile. In a full tuxedo, you’re equally at home at a fancy gala or a drunken beach party, a black-tie wedding or a backyard mud-wrestling tournament, a champagne cruise or a race through the woods to find the EpiPen that a squirrel stole from your cousin. I feel like I can go anywhere in a tuxedo, and that’s why I love wearing one.\n\n5. You’ve been an outspoken political activist in recent years, leading Black Lives Matter marches and working to secure aid for people affected by the Flint, Michigan water crisis. What drives you to be politically engaged?\n\nIt’s simple. I know that if I don’t do something about the problems in our society, someone else will have to—and I’m worried that it would end up being someone weird, like that guy from the Guinness Book Of World Records with the beard of bees. I don’t want to see the bees guy become an activist, so I step up.",

         "1.4 million college kids will drink alcohol today",
         "On any given day in America, roughly 1.4 million college students between the ages of 18 and 22 — or more than 1 out of every 8 American undergrads — will drink alcohol, according to new data from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Those who partake will consume an average of about four drinks each — just below the five-drink threshold that defines binge drinking. Of course, many of them will drink more than that. Many will drink less.\n\nOther young people will opt to alter their consciousness with different substances. Roughly 900,000 college students, or 1 in 12, will get stoned. About 15,000 will do cocaine, 13,000 will do hallucinogens of some kind (magic mushrooms, LSD), and more than 7,200 will do heroin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very next day, the exact same scenario will play out again. Some of those who drink and do drugs tomorrow will be the same ones who drank and did drugs today. Others will take a break from the partying, perhaps waiting a day, a week or a month before doing it again.\n\nIt all adds up to paint a vivid picture of the prevalence of substance use among college kids in America today. This isn't necessarily a problem — statistically speaking, most of this drinking and drug-taking is normal behavior. Most college drinkers and drug users graduate on to their next phase of life without suffering any adverse consequences from all those nights at the bar.\n\nBut if it's normal behavior, it also isn't without risk. On-campus drinking and drug use is associated with higher dropout rates. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, each year college-age drinking directly leads to:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1,825 deaths\n\n690,000 assaults\n\n97,000 sexual assaults\n\n599,000 other injuries\n\n150,000 alcohol-related health problems\n\nCollege students aren't alone when it comes to a propensity to overdo it. People between the ages of 18 and 25 are generally the heaviest users of substances legal and illegal, regardless of whether they're in college. But the overall trends in drug and alcohol use among this group are generally moving in a positive direction.\n\nSince 2002, for instance, America's 18-to-25-year-olds have become less likely to use illicit drugs other than marijuana. They've become significantly less likely to use tobacco. And while their overall use of alcohol is about the same, their rates of problematic drinking — bingeing and heavy alcohol use — are down sharply, especially among young men.\n\nSo while the top-line numbers of millions of college drinkers may seem alarming, consider the flip side of the coin as well: If 1 out of every 8 college kids is drinking on any given night, that means the other seven kids are doing something else — like going to the library, playing games or just hanging out with friends.\n\nAdvertisement",

         "Get The Tissues Ready: The Next Song On This Emo Album Is Just A Guy’s First Name So You Know It’s Going To Be About The Lead Singer’s Friend Who Died When They Were In High School",
         "Get The Tissues Ready: The Next Song On This Emo Album Is Just A Guy’s First Name So You Know It’s Going To Be About The Lead Singer’s Friend Who Died When They Were In High School\n\nIf you’re not in the mood for a good cry, you’re gonna want to stop here, because the waterworks are about to be turned all the way up: The next song on this emo album is just a guy’s first name, so you know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s friend who died when they were in high school.\n\nYup, it’s pretty clear. There’s basically only one way this next song could go, and it’s going to be an absolute downer.\n\nEverything’s pretty much been par for the course as the second song on this emo album winds down. The first two songs were titled “I Feel January In My Bones” and “These Hands For The Trembling,” and covered standard emo fare like the vague sadness of realizing that the people you once looked up to don’t have all the answers and how all of the lead singer’s high school friends used to have big dreams but ended up getting stuck in their hometown. But things are definitely about to get much more bleak because the third track on the album is just called “Mikey,” so you just fucking know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s best friend from high school who couldn’t overcome his debilitating opioid addiction and overdosed or died in a car accident or some depressing shit like that.\n\nWhile it was easy to tell that this album was going to be at least a little sad by the looks of the cover art, which just shows an upperish-middle-class suburban house in the wintertime and has the band’s name stamped in a simple cursive font on the bottom right corner, it’s pretty clear that once “Mikey” starts, the vibe of the album is about to go from general angsty-sad to full-blown-crying sad.\n\nSeriously, you should definitely turn the album off before it gets to “Mikey” unless you want to listen to the lead singer blame himself for his friend’s early death with lines like, “I should’ve been there when you needed me most//and now I waltz with the cold of your ghost,” or, “Your eyes were too hazy to see the tears in mine//and now yours are shut forever.” Point blank, this is going to be a massive bummer.\n\nFinal warning, because the current song is wrapping up now, so if you don’t bail now, you’re about to get emotionally wrecked by “Mikey.” It’s almost definitely going to start off quietly and slowly build up until the lead singer is full-blown screaming metaphors that describe his friend as a short but intense mid-summer storm casting brief shadows across forgotten power lines, and it’s probably going to leave you feeling melancholy for the rest of the day. But if you have your tissues handy and are ready to hear the lead singer and the drummer sing intertwining vocals about how the friend’s funeral scarred the lead singer so badly that he can’t even walk past the church it was held in anymore or something along those lines, then strap the fuck in and let the tears roll. Good luck!",

         "Firefighters Rescued Litter Of Puppies. Then They Realized They Weren’t Actually Dogs",
         "Nothing could have prepared the men and women from the Colorado Springs Fire Department received THIS SOS call.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the scene, they started pulling out a litter of 8 puppies who were trapped in a sewer. A few hours later they realized they couldn’t have been more wrong about them.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what happened when the firemen realized they weren’t puppies they were bringing to safety.\n\nMulti-Faceted\n\nFirefighters are informed that they will regularly be called out to jobs that have nothing to do with fighting fires!\n\nMany people also make the mistake of assuming that firefighters only help people. In actuality, these hard-working men and women assist anyone.\n\nOne team of firefighters was about to help something unexpected.\n\nAnother Day\n\nFor the team of firefighters at the Colorado Springs Fire Department, it was another day at the station.\n\nToday was going to require that the team take part in a rescue. The outcome wasn’t going to be anything like they’d imagined.\n\nWhat would this day bring?\n\nThe Call\n\nThe Colorado Springs Fire Department got a phone call one day. It was a distress call to help some animals.\n\nWithin a few minutes, they were answering the call. The faster they got there, the faster they could assist the animals.\n\nThis was going to be a very unique rescue.\n\nProtocol\n\nIn any situation that includes animals, firefighters have to take specific precautions.\n\nRegardless of what it was, every animal had its own unexpected mannerisms and behaviors. This was especially true when an animal was in danger and could feel threatened.\n\nBetter to be safe than sorry.\n\nReady for Anything\n\nWith this in mind, the firefighters needed to proceed carefully. In every situation, it was important that the firefighters maintain their own safety.\n\nThis team had no idea what type of animal they were about to save, so they had to be cautious.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to hear the rescue unfold!\n\nExperience\n\nLuckily, the firefighters weren’t too worried about this particular job. In fact, the team had lots of experience.\n\nEven though they weren’t sure what kind of animal was in trouble, it was safe to say that they would be able to handle it.\n\nThis time things would be different! Click ‘Next’!\n\nAssessing the Situation\n\nThey got into their truck and raced to the location where the distressed animals appeared to be.\n\nThe animals were trapped deep beneath a storm grate. If the weather changed and it filled with water, the animals would be in trouble.\n\nWhat was waiting inside? You’ll never guess!\n\nTick Tock\n\nWithout rainy weather, the animals were fairly safe in the enclosure.\n\nThe firefighters knew that time was of the essence. Not only was the enclosure dark and deep, but it was also cold! There was no time to waste.\n\nWhat was the game plan? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Plan\n\nThe firefighters came to the conclusion that the creatures were likely fairly small. The sewer grate wasn’t very deep, and yet the animals still couldn’t get out.\n\nOnly one or two men would be needed to pull the animals out. Everyone prepped themselves.\n\nYou won’t guess what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Glance\n\nThe firefighters worked together to raise the storm grate away and expose the area beneath. They could hear the small cries of animals below.\n\nThey were quick to realize that this little group of creatures were babies. What were they doing there?\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Unfit Home\n\nThis was a very odd place for small animals to be. Animals are much better off being in the wild.\n\nThese animals were far away from any wild habitat, and weren’t going to get what they needed in this sewer grate.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbandoned Babies?\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t be sure what kind of animals were trapped in the storm drain. They took time to canvas the area.\n\nIt was likely that if there was a mom or dad around, the firefighters would have spooked them away.\n\nWhat would the firefighters do? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bad Situation\n\nWhen they saw the babies, they couldn’t believe that they were still alive. The sewer was filled with dirt and garbage.\n\nThe animals must have been freezing cold, and there was clearly no food in sight to be eaten.\n\nWould the poor babies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitive Situation\n\nThe firefighters had to approach carefully. If the mother was nearby, then perhaps she would be the one to save them.\n\nBut, if the firefighters did handle the babies, the mother may return later and decide to abandon them.\n\nTime was running out. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nTense Moments\n\nThe team of rescuers weren’t sure what kind of animals these were, which made it hard to know if the mother might be around.\n\nThere was no way of knowing what was best, but it looked like these critters needed assistance.\n\nWhat would they do!? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Decision\n\nThe firefighters had a decision to make. Should they leave the babies there, or wait for the mother to return?\n\nThey knew the babies couldn’t get out themselves. It was time to find out what animal they were dealing with.\n\nWe can’t make this up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating\n\nThe firefighters would have to investigate, by pulling out the animals and identifying exactly what they were.\n\nIf they were domestic, it was likely that these animals needed some serious help. Other wild animals might not be so desperate.\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rescue Begins\n\nThe team made sure to wear gloves, so as to avoid getting their natural smell onto the babies.\n\nA sheet was laid out beside the sewer, so that they could easily place the animals down safely once they were rescued.\n\nWe can’t make this up! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First\n\nThe firefighter slowly reached down into the sewer and gently pulled up the first baby.\n\nAt first glance, the team was in shock at the small furry animal. It was actually very cute and rolled around on the sheet innocently.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what the firefighters found!\n\n\n\n\n\nMan’s Best Friend\n\nAfter getting a good look at the first baby, the team knew what they were dealing with: Puppies!\n\nThey had no idea how the animals had gotten there, but now they knew for sure that they shouldn’t be there.\n\nWhat happens next will shock you! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sad State\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe it. The team worried that the puppies were put there by someone.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn’t uncommon for pet owners to abandon their pets. Sometimes they assume the only option is to dispose of them when desperate.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nHard Truths\n\nThe team hoped that abandonment wasn’t the case in this situation. That would have been so heartbreaking for the poor puppies\n\nWith this potential circumstance in mind, the firefighters pressed on even faster to try and help the puppies.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out why the firefighters were so angry!\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Solution\n\nFor those pet owners who aren’t able to take care of their animals, the firefighters knew that this could be a good lesson for everyone.\n\nIt is never okay to abandon animals in unfit environments. The team hoped this wasn’t the true case.\n\nThe rescue was going forward! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Litter\n\nThere was no telling how many were inside the sewer grate at first, so the team had to wait until all of them were out.\n\nLuckily, the sewer wasn’t too deep, so it was easy for the firefighters to get them all.\n\nWhat would the team do next? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Huddle\n\nThe puppies were surely very confused. One moment they were in a sewer and the next, surrounded by humans.\n\nThe poor puppies huddled together for warmth. It was clear that they had been like this for a few days.\n\nWhat happened to these little guys? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering Clues\n\nThe team was still confused as to how this situation had even begun. They spoke first with the witness who reported it.\n\nShe explained that she spotted the puppies being swept along a fast-moving stream and into the storm drain.\n\nThis lady was a regular day hero. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sigh of Relief\n\nThe lady recalled what had happened. They were glad that they hadn’t been physically put into the sewer by someone.\n\nThis changed the situation drastically. Somehow the puppies had gotten too close to the storm drain and been swept inside.\n\nThe puppies mysterious story continued. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Moves\n\nWhen the lady saw the puppies being swept away, she tried to act quickly. She tried to catch up with the puppies in time, but it was too late.\n\nShe tried to open the grate, but she didn’t have the tools.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what she did!\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling in for Help\n\nWhen the woman realized that she couldn’t help the animals herself, she decided to make the call for help.\n\nLuckily, the firefighters knew what to do, and they had the tools that were needed. They were grateful that she had called.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out something amazing about the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Great Example\n\nThe firefighters were glad to hear the actual story of the puppies. One civilian had noticed something in danger and made sure that she took action.\n\nThey hoped that everyone would do the same if they ever encountered such a situation.\n\nThe firefighters investigate. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Guesses\n\nThe the firefighters started trying to guess what kind of breed they were. All of the puppies were black with short, wiry hair.\n\nThey decided that the puppies must be Labrador puppies. It seemed like this was the best guess.\n\nThe team was going to be in for a surprise. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that all of the puppies were safe, it was time to make sure that they were all healthy.\n\nWith that, the team took the puppies to a Humane Society, in order to make sure that the animals were okay.\n\nWould the puppies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Good Shape\n\nThe firefighters were happy to hear that all of the puppies were in relatively good health. None of them seemed to be malnourished, and they were very strong.\n\nWith that, the firefighters decided that their job was complete.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’ to see what happens to the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Call\n\nMark Jenkins was one of the firefighters who was a part of the rescue. After the pups were dropped off, he left his phone number for updates.\n\nHe didn’t expect to hear about them so soon, but he got a call right after.\n\nWere the puppies okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting News\n\nThe vet was quick to assure Mark that the animals were fine, and that they did a good deed of sending them over to the vet.\n\nIt was a surprising piece of information that almost made Mark laugh out loud.\n\nWhat was the amazing surprise? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Surprise\n\nWhat the vet had to tell Mark was that the puppies had a little surprise for him.\n\nIn fact, the puppies …weren’t even dogs at all! Mark couldn’t believe his ears. They weren’t even dogs? How was this possible?\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nShocking News\n\nThe vet explained that the animals were dogs at all, but actually foxes! And they were red foxes to be exact.\n\nThe vet explained that puppies and fox cubs do have some similarities at birth, particularly because red foxes often aren’t red.\n\nThis was shocking! Click ‘Next’ to find out how it all happened!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Deed\n\nMark shared the news with the rest of his team, and they couldn’t believe the news either. Everyone had been so sure that they were puppies.\n\nRegardless of the new developments, the team was happy that they could help. It was a good day!\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe what they had to do next! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing Back\n\nEven though the baby foxes had now been saved, their story was not even close to being over!\n\nThe vet explained that the mother might still be in the area. If they could put the babies back in time, she might find them.\n\nWould the plan work? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth a Shot\n\nThey felt like they were going back a bit, but the firefighters knew that taking the foxes back was the only way. Reluctantly, the small animals went back into their sewer drain.\n\nOf course, the babies were watched closely during this time.\n\nTime would tell if the mother would return. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience\n\nOnce all of the foxes were returned to their sewer, the team waited patiently. It was important that they keep a safe distance away.\n\nIt was possible that she wouldn’t return until night. It was a waiting game for everyone.\n\nYou won’t believe what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Practices\n\nThe red fox is a very cunning animal. Most red foxes stay inside their den during the day, and move about during the night.\n\nUnfortunately, there were no signs of the mother overnight; they hoped she’s return in the morning.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Show\n\nUnfortunately, after a lot of waiting, there was no sign of the mother fox. The babies could be heard inside the sewer calling for her.\n\nShe may have been spooked by all of the action that happened earlier in the day.\n\nWhat would they do now? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving In\n\nAfter a lot of waiting, everyone’s patience seemed to wear out. It was assumed that the mother wasn’t going to be coming back after a few nights.\n\nWith time, it was decided that it was time to intervene again. The baby foxes needed assistance.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out where the foxes ended up!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nWhen the decision was made, it was time to make moves. The animals were once again gathered from the sewer and brought to the Animal Clinic of Woodland Park.\n\nThe clinic was going to be a huge help for these foxes.\n\nYou don’t want to miss this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Lessons\n\nThe clinic offers help and rehabilitation to animals of all shapes and sizes.\n\nFor other animals, like the baby foxes, the team at the clinic help to raise the babies until they are old enough to take care of themselves in the wild.\n\nThe foxes were in good hands, but the story wasn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming Educated\n\nThe story of the foxes was a funny one, but it was also an educational one. The team of firefighters learned a lot about them during this rescue.\n\nThere is so much to know about wild animals and how to deal with them.\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Very Surprising\n\nFinding the baby foxes was a huge surprise for the firefighters, but it wasn’t a huge surprise to animal experts.\n\nIt was likely that the mother fox has mated just months earlier and had given birth to them.\n\nThis wasn’t the only thing that made sense. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Spot\n\nAnimal experts also weren’t surprised by the find, since the cubs were found in Colorado. This state is well-known for its fox population.\n\nColorado has all kinds of perfect terrain for foxes, including mountains, hills, and lots of perfect places for dens.\n\nThis part is shocking. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Acceptable Place\n\nIt seemed unheard of that the mother fox would put her babies in a sewer grate. However, animal experts also understood why she might have done this.\n\nIn their natural habitat, their dens are commonly dark, cool spaces.\n\nThis mother fox made a mistake. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nHonest Mistake\n\nThe mother fox who left these cubs behind may have made a bit of a mistake when she was picking her den.\n\nThe sewer was dark and cool, and had similar characteristics to a common den in the fox’s natural habitat.\n\nThis story gets even crazier. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Birth\n\nThe story of the fox cubs was slowly coming together. Although no one could guess how the babies got there at first.\n\nThe most likely answer, was that the mother fox had actually given birth to her babies inside the sewer!\n\nWould the foxes be okay? Click ‘Next’ to learn more!\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Outlook\n\nEven though the baby foxes had been abandoned, there was still a good chance that the baby foxes were going to be okay.\n\nTo make matters even better, the baby foxes had gone through serious rehabilitation at a young age.\n\nYou won’t believe this fact. Click ‘Next’ to hear it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Occurrence\n\nThe firefighters were surprised at finding baby foxes in the busy city, but it isn’t actually an uncommon occurrence.\n\nThis is often a result of growing cities, which are starting to take over the habitat that foxes would usually roam in.\n\nWhat if a fox chooses your home? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapting\n\nThe sad thing about foxes becoming comfortable in urban areas, is that they are often seen as pests and miscreants.\n\nIt gets harder and harder for animals to find homes as habitat loss continues. People don’t understand why the foxes are nearby.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out how you can help!\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for Help\n\nThe lady who came across them did the right thing, when she decided to call for help.\n\nIt’s much better to call the appropriate help, who can handle the animals safely and assess the situation properly. Many animals should simply be left alone!\n\nWhat do you need to know?! Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Not Always Bad\n\nWhen people find baby animals that are alone, they often assume that the baby is in trouble. However, this is not always the case.\n\nSome newborn animals, such as rabbits, are alone for almost 23 hours in a day!\n\nAll in a day’s work. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Happy Ending\n\nFor these baby foxes, their ending was a happy one. One caring lady and some firefighters were able to make sure that they were well taken care of.\n\nGoing forward, the cubs will be able to grow up in their natural habitat together.\n\nThe story isn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping A Look Out\n\nWith more and more suburban growth, animals will continue to struggle for their own, personal space.\n\nIf you do happen to come across an animal that seems out of place, it’s a great idea to contact local authorities for assistance.\n\nThat Was The Last One!

         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session",
         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session\n\nThe relationship between therapist and patient can be a complicated one, and sometimes, it’s hard to tell exactly what your therapist is thinking. Here are four signs that your therapist is planning on hightailing it to Six Flags Great America right after you finish your session.\n\n1. She keeps blaming your fear of intimacy on the fact that you didn’t ride enough roller coasters as a child: If your therapist is antsy to get to Six Flags and just phoning it in until then, chances are she’s probably already got roller coasters on the brain, and that might end up coming out in your session. Sure, it’s possible that your therapist is just using roller coasters as some sort of metaphor for the ups and downs of life, but if she keeps bringing up specific rides like the Fiddler’s Fling while you’re talking through your difficulty with letting people in, it’s likely because she can’t wait to leave you mid-sentence on the couch the second your time is up and head straight to the amusement park.\n\n2. She’s insisting that the best way for you to solve your conflict with your parents is to measure her to make sure she’s taller than 54 inches, the minimum height required to ride the Raging Bull: If your therapist whips out a measuring tape while you’re on the verge of a major breakthrough about your childhood and tells you the best way to heal is to double-check that she’s over 54 inches tall, it’s a pretty good sign that she’s planning on heading to Six Flags in the very near future. Fifty-four inches isn’t that tall, so it only makes sense someone who has immediate plans to ride the Raging Bull or any of Great America’s other height-restricted rides would be so concerned with passing what would otherwise seem like a relatively arbitrary height requirement. And if she’s willing to interrupt you in the middle of your session, it’s likely because she doesn’t have long before she’s hitting the road to Six Flags.\n\n3. You overhear her muttering, “I wish therapy had a Flash Pass,” to herself: If your therapist looks distractedly out the window and imagines a world where therapy had a device that allowed her to cut right to the end of your session, it’s pretty clear her head is already in Gurnee, IL, soaking in the sights and sounds of Great America. This might be the first time she’s splurged on the real Six Flags Flash Pass, so if she’s doing the “wrap it up” motion while you’re talking about how your parents got divorced on your eighth birthday, it’s because she’s daydreaming about running from Goliath to Viper without having to wait in long lines.\n\n4. She tells you you’re cured: On its face, this is great news, but don’t allow yourself to be too caught up in the moment before you take some time to assess the situation. Do you feel cured? If the answer is no, your therapist may just be trying to rush you out of the door so she can get on the road to Six Flags before traffic sets in. If your therapist announces that you’ve finally made peace with your demons and have reached the highest level of self-actualization while she’s hurriedly applying sunscreen to her forearms and shoving a Six Flags Flash Pass into her pocket, then chances are that you still may have some work to do, and your therapist is just going to Great America.",

         "SANTA FE, TX—In the hours following a violent rampage in Texas in which a lone attacker killed eight individuals and seriously injured several others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Friday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. “This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them,” said Ohio resident Erica Webb, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world’s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. “It’s a shame, but what can we do? There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”",

         "‘The Joker’ Reviewed By An Angry Mother Who Hasn’t Seen It Share:\n\nTHE HIGHLY controversial movie (according to online media) has been the source of fierce debate (according to online media) sparking calls for discussions on how movie violence encourages real life imitators (according to online media).\n\nThe Joker, released today in cinemas, illegal downloads, in the ‘synopsis’ section of Wikipedia pages and in carefully crafted online summaries designed to coax people into apoplectic rage fits is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nIn an effort to make no effort whatsoever to provide an actual expert on such matters with an important platform in a widely read publication that could see this push for faux controversy disproved and deflated we have instead asked Karen Carty (51), who is very mad at the violence and toxic messages contained in a movie she hasn’t seen, to review ‘The Joker’:\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen, a mother-of-three, began while tutting dismissively.\n\n“Suppose it’s not as bad over here when ya show violent sorts of movies, but Jesus Christ, people over in America are trying to go see this movie dressed as the Joker. It’s depraved stuff,” Karen added, alluding to some US cinemas operating a ban on people wearing Joker clothes, but allowing people to carry guns because America.\n\n“What ever happened to that hunk Cesar Romero who used to be Joker, how did the Joker come to this? I remember the worst violence in Batman was when they were climbing up the side of a building and being shouted at by apartment owners, now it’s bombs this, semi-automatic weapons that,” added Karen of the bygone era of the 1960s when murder had yet to be invented by violent video games.\n\n“I hear it’s awful violent, and it’s making kids mad for murder,” a shocked Karen explained, one hand covering her mouth to further illustrate her shock at coming to the conclusion that someone had made a movie that was so violently persuasive it could flip a switch in thousands of innocent minds and turn them into demented killers.\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen reiterated. “They shouldn’t be allowed make that sort of movie,” added Karen turning angry at the thought of a film news outlets told her would give her that warm angry feeling if she just clicked the link on their article.\n\n“Downton Abbey, now there’s a lovely movie. Why can’t people just make more of them?”",

         "Hurricane Irma live updates: Images of devastation emerge from Florida Keys as storm batters Georgia and South Carolina",
         "Preparing for Irma? There’s an app for that\n\nFalse information being spread about @Zello and what it can do during and after storm. Here are the facts https://t.co/5p5TIEpwgG pic.twitter.com/EH8cCJrRAy — WPLG Local 10 News (@WPLGLocal10) September 6, 2017\n\nZello, an app that turns cellphones into walkie-talkies, connecting and broadcasting traffic like a police scanner, has become an emergency hub for nervous Floridians awaiting Hurricane Irma’s landfall Sunday.\n\nThe technology originated a decade ago, and was increasingly used during clashes in Egypt, Ukraine and Venezuela. Last week, it became the most popular free app for both Android and iPhone users after Hurricane Harvey struck Texas. Volunteers there used Zello channels such as Cajun Navy Dispatch to provide advice to flood victims and information to civilian rescuers.\n\nLate Saturday, one of the most popular channels, Hurricane Irma, had attracted more than a thousand users from across the world, primarily in Florida.\n\nCalls came from young mothers, teenage boys, power line workers, veterans and emergency responders. Some reported tornadoes, others rising water, exploding transformers and suspicious activity on web cams. Some worried about looting. They shared storm surge maps, apps to track tornadoes and monitor weather radar. Many asked about evacuating. A few joked. Most pleaded for help, worried that time was running out for them and their families.\n\nA glimpse of their fraught discussions, starting just after dark at 7 p.m. Eastern time (some users rely on nicknames, while others provide their real name and location):\n\nBarbaraw2 (New Middletown, Ohio): People in the Sarasota area evacuate now. You have exactly one hour. If you do not know where a shelter is, look up www.capecoralupdate shelter. There are shelters open now.\n\nCaraRogers (Palm Bay, Fla.): Guys to correct her, you have 45 minutes, not an hour. Barbara can you copy, 45 minutes?\n\nBarbaraw2: Copy Cara, I meant to say 45\n\nPusom (Nelson Gonzalez): Is there any way I can get wifi during the storm?\n\nCaraRogers: At this time guys, Wifi is the least of your worries\n\nAmeer Saleem 18: Xfinity has set up mobile hotspots throughout Florida.\n\nKdrkvz: (Dave, assistant emergency coordinator, Galloway, NJ) There was a woman asking about Spanish language info, can you let her talk?\n\nPacposhopez: (boy chuckling) Um, I got a question, what’s the name of the hurricane?\n\nLcjcus: Someone should be talking about the tornado warnings in Palm Beach and Miami Dade counties that were just issued\n\nRosa&Lex (Rosa, shelter worker, Las Vegas): Hey guys, I just want to let you know that I have a channel for the Spanish speaking community it’s ##irmaayudainformacionespanol\n\nCommsTech: There’s also sister site of ours that’s Hurricane Irma espanol.\n\nDylan_ball: People who haven’t evacuated already are frickin ignorant. This is ridiculous.\n\nRed Actual (Delray Beach, Fla.): You need to evacuate. The storm has shifted to western Florida. Storm surges are expected to rise to 12 feet. The governor has issued an evacuation. If you do not evacuate you will not get rescued until the storm passes.\n\nKearrah Hollis (Floral City, Fla.): If you are in need of rescue put a bright colored towel or sheet on top of your house.\n\nPJS203: Por favor hablo espanol, gracias.\n\nPierre G (Ontario, Canada): Multiple tornadoes have touched down in Broward County as we speak\n\nBenbruh (youth): There’s a tornado in Tampa. Please leave the area now\n\nBeaver (youth): I’m in Tampa, there’s no damn tornado.\n\nCaraRogers: Guys, we have to keep these channels clear! This is some people’s only way to get assistance, because 911 is not going to be dispatching fire and police. You will be silenced if you come in with something irrelevant. Keep the station clear.\n\nIamnisa1: Does anybody know when the hurricane is coming to Lehigh Acres, Ft Myers area? I have a one year old and I’m really worried. I’m not prepared.\n\nCaraRogers: To the mother of the one year old, you still have time to get to call 311 and get to shelter.\n\nSammy9225 (Samantha Allen, Port Richey, Fla.): Is it too soon to have a bag ready to go? I have two bags ready for me and my family and should I take my son’s car seat out of my car now or leave it in there?\n\nRubenthecuben1 Ruben Solis, Summerfield, Fla.): I live in a mobile home, do you have any idea what I should do? Board up my windows?\n\nCaraRogers: If you are in a mobile home you need to evacuate immediately and get to a shelter.\n\nRubenthecuben1: So should I not board up my windows or should I board up my windows on my mobile home?\n\nBarbaraw2: No, you should get out of your mobile home now!\n\n(people laugh) No seriously, you can board up your windows if you want, but I would not stay there in that mobile home. You really seriously need to evacuate and go to a safer place.\n\nBarbaraw2: Also if you evacuate, take a black sharpie and put the number of people that went with you so that keeps the rescuers from having to come up to check. It just keeps everything going.\n\nUomshouse: Don’t let people know you evacuated unless you want to get robbed.\n\nBarbaraw2: Your personal stuff is not important as much as your life is.\n\nSammy9925: (baby cries in background) I’m in Port Richey, Florida. When it hits and if our windows break and we go to the middle of our house, what do we do after that because we did not get enough wood to do all of our windows, unfortunately.\n\nCaraRogers: What you are going to do is go to a center area with no windows or if it gets to be as serious as it may you’re going to want to go into the bathroom and get your family into the bathtub and cover the bathtub with something that can shield you from falling debris.\n\nStormwatch3000: If you get in a bath tub for a tornado the best thing to put on top of you is a mattress.\n\nJoako537: I’m here in Tampa trying to find out where I can get a generator.\n\nCommsTech: Man, I think you’re a little late on that.",

         "Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex",
         "TOPEKA, KS—Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible.\n\nDuring a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation’s heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group’s long-standing mission and values.\n\n“Although we’ve traditionally dedicated 97 percent of our resources to other important services such as contraception distribution, cancer screening, and STD testing, this new complex allows us to devote our full attention to what has always been our true passion: abortion,” said Richards, standing under a banner emblazoned with Planned Parenthood’s new slogan, “No Life Is Sacred.” “And since Congress voted to retain our federal funding, it’s going to be that much easier for us to maximize the number of tiny, beating hearts we stop every day.”\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/a-look-inside-planned-parenthoods-8-billion-abortionpl-1819590293\n\n“The Abortionplex’s high-tech machinery is capable of terminating one pregnancy every three seconds,” Richards added. “That’s almost a million abortions every month. We’re so thrilled!”\n\nThe 900,000-square-foot facility has more than 2,000 rooms dedicated to the abortion procedure. The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives.\n\nThe remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater—features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event.\n\n“We really want abortion to become a regular part of women’s lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions,” said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. “Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus.”\n\n“All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex,” Richards continued. “Whether she’s a high school junior who doesn’t want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can’t be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control—all are welcome.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Marcy Kolrath, one of the Abortionplex’s first clients, told reporters that despite her initial hesitancy, she was quickly put at ease by staff members who reassured her that she could have abortions over and over for the next decade before finally committing to motherhood. Kolrath also said she was “wowed” by the facility’s many attractions.\n\n“I was kind of on the fence in the beginning,” she said. “But after a couple of margaritas and a ride down the lazy river they’ve got circling the place, I got caught up in the vibe. By the time it was over, I almost wished I could’ve aborted twins and gotten to stay a little longer.”\n\n“I told my boyfriend we had to have sex again that very night,” Kolrath added. “I really want to come back over Labor Day.”",

         "Why Would Regulators Ban Kratom, An Herb For Recovering Addicts?",
         "Image Credit Wikimedia\n\nOnce Andrew Turner learned of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s plan to ban the medicinal herb he uses to manage a host of medical issues, he did what many activists do: recorded his personal testimony and put it up on YouTube.\n\nThe Navy veteran didn’t just tell his story; he could actually show what life without Kratom was like for him. Turner suffers from combat-related disabilities, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, Meige syndrome, and dystonia. He takes a small amount of powdered leaf from the Kratom plant once daily to treat his conditions.\n\nIn October, he stopped taking Kratom for six days and recorded his deteriorating condition to demonstrate “what the reality of a Kratom ban looks like.” On day five, excessive blinking, a twitching brow, and swallowing interrupted his speech. His speech was slow and labored. “This is what I’ll have to face” if Kratom is banned, he says, since “the pharmaceutical measures don’t really help; they typically make these issues a little bit worse.”\n\nBy day 6, a rapid succession of tics pull and twist his facial expressions, and his stuttering is uncontrollable. “If this continues on,” he says, “within a few more days I’ll probably have complete inability to speak…[and] the pain I woke up with this morning was very unbearable.”\n\nThousands Share Andrew Turner’s Story\n\nThough Meige syndrome isn’t common, what binds this veteran’s story to thousands of other testimonies from Kratom users is how taking Kratom has allowed them to stop using prescription opiates, or avoid them altogether. As Turner explains: “For a long time I’ve worked with doctors and the DOD to manage my symptoms…turned out that with just a little bit [of Kratom] each morning, I was able to stop using opiates…large amounts of vicodin, Percosets. I haven’t taken any in months…I can do things on my own again without others helping me.”\n\nMany veterans have found success using Kratom to treat chronic pain and PTSD, as founder of American Kratom Association Susan Ash told U.S. News and many wrote to the DEA when it opened the potential regulations for public comment. Abraham, a former U.S. Army sergeant, wrote, “It is one of the only medicines that help tremendously with my PTSD without being hepatotoxic…I had multiple buddies with whom I worked with who were at risk for suicide. They were introduced to Kratom and now are living normal lives.”\n\nMany veterans’ stories can be found on YouTube under the hashtag #IAmKratom. Josh, a disabled veteran with two back surgeries, anxiety, and PTSD told viewers how he “walked around feeling like a zombie” on the 12 medications the military hospital had prescribed him before he switched to Kratom. “I feel better in these 3 years that I’ve had Kratom than the six years before that,” he said.\n\nCurtis, a disabled infantry Army vet, said he was put on pharmaceuticals to help with PTSD and opiate painkillers to manage his chronic pain. “It was a pretty bad time for me…I decided to give [Kratom] a try, and within the first two hours of having my first spoonful, my pain was almost completely gone. Over the first few weeks, my crushing depression and anxiety had started to go away.” He says now he doesn’t take any other medications and can provide for his family.\n\nAsh says she uses Kratom to treat chronic pain from Lyme disease and broke her addiction to opioids with its help. Many other non-veterans testified to its efficacy in managing pain. One woman, 48, wrote, “I suffer excruciating, haneous [sic], debilitating pain EVERY minute of every day. Kratom stopped it dead in its tracks. I am now LIVING. I work again, I’m a mother again, a wife again.”\n\nIs This Leaf Akin to Heroin or Ecstacy?\n\nThousands of such consumers spoke out when in August 2016 the DEA notified the public of its intent to add the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the Schedule I category, a decision “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.” This would have put the ancient herb from Southeast Asia in such unsavory company as heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, and other drugs determined by the DEA to have, “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”\n\nThe DEA has the power to immediately ban a drug, then issue permits for its use as they see fit. Placing Kratom in the Schedule I category may seem drastic considering its comparatively mild nature to other Schedule I drugs, but that’s the only category into which DEA can place drugs if it wants to ban them quickly without express permission from Congress.\n\nJournalist Anthony Roberts reported that within the first week alone more than 100,000 people signed the petition to keep Kratom unscheduled. More than 23,000 posted comments with overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n\nTurner says vendor sales estimate that between 3 and 5 million people in the United States have tried Kratom, and the market is growing. More than 55, 000 kilograms of dried Kratom leaves and powder have been encountered “at ports of entry” to the United States between 2014 and 2016.\n\nAfter the massive outcry from Kratom users, on October 12, 2016 DEA withdrew its plan to schedule Kratom. Spokesman Melvin Patteson said the reversal is “something we’ve never done before.” DEA opened another public comment period and requested that the Food and Drug Administration do an “8 factor analysis” before making a scheduling decision. That analysis has yet to be conducted, but an eight-factor analysis commissioned by the American Kratom Association and performed by PinneyAssociates found Kratom “appears overall much safer [than opioids].”\n\nAccording to Dr. Jack Henningfield, one of the analysis’ authors, “Its favorable safety profile supports continued access by consumers to appropriately regulated products while research on its uses continues.” So prospects look brighter for the botanical than they did just a few months ago.\n\nOther Benefits and Effects of Kratom\n\nThe leaves of the plant in question (Mitragyna Speciosa) have purportedly been used by natives for millennia and, more recently, by U.S. consumers for its calming and analgesic properties; often as an alternative to prescription opioids.\n\nKratom is fairly inexpensive. A low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain. One Kratom user wrote her medications for managing the pain of fibromyalgia were “more than her disability check.” “It’s such a cheap substance,” explains Turner, “You’re not going to have people breaking into homes to finance their Kratom habit.”\n\nPrevious analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester of personal experiences aggregated on Erowid.org (“a psychoactive substance information site”) found among Kratom’s effects, “what appears to be a mild (i.e., relative to opiates) dependence syndrome.”\n\nA low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain.\n\nBut some Kratom users report dependency as a real struggle, some saying it suppresses their creativity and heightens complacency. One user who described himself as “addicted to Kratom for 2 and a half years, typically at 20-25 grams a day” commented on Reddit, “Kratom made me complacent and sloppy, but also stifled my creativity. It’s funny how when you are on kratom your standards sink so low. There’s this weird complacency like ‘since I feel good anything I do is good enough.’”\n\nAnother quitter described the plant as “the green deception” and “a puppeteer.” Still another recreational user reported insomnia, depression, anxiety, and hot and cold sweats while withdrawing from use of 8-12g a day—an amount Turner equates to “shoveling it down” and “chasing a big-time high.” Other users report consumption upwards of 30g a day.\n\nReddit contains multiple threads of negative Kratom experiences, especially withdrawal symptoms. Notably, many are from users who do not report using Kratom to treat pre-existing conditions, report consuming very high doses, or are also on other medications (for instance, the user who reported insomnia was also taking Prozac). Such instances would support the DEA’s position that Kratom is “being abused for its opioid-like properties.”\n\n“It still has risks just like anything one ingests,” Turner said, warning against trying Kratom before doing the research or “chasing a high that just really isn’t there.” “There is no actual high from kratom that you could dare compare to even the mildest opiate,” Ash told U.S. News.\n\nIn low doses (roughly 2-4g), Kratom has a stimulating and “uplifting” effect, and some consumers say it gives them focus and a slight boost of motivation. In higher doses, it tends to act as a depressant and an analgesic, and it is the efficacy of Kratom in this regard that recovering opioid addicts generally testify to. Of all the appeals to keeping Kratom legal, its ability to decrease or eliminate opioid users’ dependence is the strongest.\n\nKratom Could Be an Exit-Ramp Drug\n\nOne man, who became addicted to opium poppies and then to heroin, said of the plant: “Kratom took someone who had no desire, at all, to stop using opiates and allowed me to quit heroin cold turkey, and remain opiate-free for over six years (and counting).”\n\nKristofer also described his experience breaking free of narcotics, “the side effects [from his medication] were absolutely awful…I was headed to the point where I was going to have to be on disability for the rest of my life. I started supplementing Kratom into my diet as needed, and it completely changed my life as well. I have experienced zero side effects, and it has helped me turn my life around to the point where I am able to work a full time job (40 hours+ a week), and provide for my family like I have never been able to do before.”\n\nNarcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nThe nation is in the throes of an opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that more than 33,000 people died from opioid use in 2015, an increase of 72 percent from the previous year, and a figure almost on par with the total traffic fatalities for the same year (35,000). Prescription opioids are powerful, and powerfully addictive. The prescription drug fentanyl, for instance, is “50 times more powerful than heroin,” as noted by CNN. Narcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nSuch highly addictive painkillers as OxyContin and Codeine are the widest gateway to heroin addiction. Amid this overwhelming opiate crisis, the DEA attempted to schedule Kratom as a drug with “no medical use,” with “no investigational new drug applications or approved new drug applications” for its main alkaloids, although the authors of the DEA’s three-factor analysis of Kratom acknowledged the plant’s analgesic properties and noted “Kratom has also been used to self-treat chronic pain and withdrawal symptoms from opioid misuse and dependence.”\n\nThe DEA also cites in the same document the increasing number of Kratom-positive blood or urine samples at private labs, which has gone from 31 positive results in 2012 to 555 positive results for 2015 through March 2016. DEA says this demonstrates rising concern over “the growing abuse” of Kratom products. The administration also cites a “tenfold increase in the number of calls received [at poison control centers] between 2010 and 2015” as evidence of growing Kratom abuse.\n\nCompare Kratom’s Effects to Those of Competing Drugs\n\nOf course, the strongest evidence supporting their case that Kratom use constitutes an “emerging public health threat” would presumable be 30 “Kratom associated deaths,” for all recorded years.\n\nThe DEA’s notice of intent and three-factor analysis calls all Kratom users “abusers.” But “abuser” isn’t found in the list of legal terms for the Controlled Substances Act; neither the FDA nor the DEA have a legal definition for “abuse,” much less “high potential for abuse.” The terms “abuse” and “abuser” are political, flexible enough to fit over an entire group of consumers regardless of the method or purpose of the product’s usage by the individual.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom.\n\nBut to compare Kratom abuse to that of opioids, we’ll employ a common definition of drug abuse, such as, “Compulsive, excessive, and self-damaging use of habit forming drugs or substances, leading to addiction or dependence.”\n\nAccording to national survey data from the Department of Health and Human Services, substance abuse for prescription pain relievers totaled roughly 2 million, and substance abuse for heroin totaled about 591,000 in 2015. That same year, there were, “20,101 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 12,990 overdose deaths related to heroin,” according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Of course, the most obvious sign of abuse are overdose fatalities: ODs from prescription pain relievers quadrupled between 1999 and 2014.\n\nBy contrast, the DEA could point to only 30 recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. According to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. Also, in all but one of those deaths, other substances were found in the systems of the deceased, (including amphetamine, heroin, methadone, and fentanyl).\n\nAs for other indicators of Kratom abuse, 660 Kratom-related calls to poison control centers were recorded between 2010 and 2015. But the CDC study of these calls the DEA cites, by their own admission, determines a correlation between the 50 severe outcomes “and exposure to Kratom plus other substances.” The three-factor analysis could point to a few cases, but no statistics or aggregate data, on other indicators for abuse, such as emergency room admissions or treatment facility admissions.\n\nHow About Regulating Before Banning?\n\nEven if one disputes the DEA’s claim that Kratom is widely abused, the Kratom market is “the wild west” in terms of regulation, as Turner acknowledges. The three-factor analysis notes that Kratom products are often marketed as a “legal high,” and falsely labeled. There is no recommended dosage amount, either. The DEA’s original scheduling notice cited lack of regulation as one of Kratom’s dangers.\n\nYet why try to ban Kratom before considering common-sense regulations? Turner said he and many other Kratom advocates would like to see more common-sense regulation of Kratom, such as restricting the age for purchase to 21 and over, and ensuring the Kratom supply isn’t tainted with harmful chemicals and that the contents are true to the advertised ingredients.\n\nA first step toward this end would be submitting Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient” to the FDA, which includes submitting evidence that Kratom is safe to consume. “I’d love to see the government come in and say we need to have some testing. I’m okay with some oversight,” says Turner, “But there’s a fine line between oversight and overreach.”\n\nWhy Did the DEA Try to Ban Kratom?\n\nWhen the government attempts to ban a substance seemingly out of nowhere, without previous widespread media coverage of the issue or public outcry, often the first suspects are other key players in the industry.\n\nJournalists and Kratom advocates have pointed to Dr. Daniel Fabricant as a force behind the proposed ban, as arguably Kratom’s most outspoken critic. In 2014, Fabricant directed the FDA’s dietary supplements division, and that year the FDA began seizing Kratom imports. In April 2014, however, Fabricant became CEO of the Natural Products Association. NPA senior vice president Corey Hilmas is also an FDA transplant.\n\n‘If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement.’\n\nSince 2014, Fabricant has been nudging regulators to crack down on Kratom. I spoke to Dr. Fabricant, who maintains the botanical should still be scheduled because it exhibits opiate-like behavior.\n\n“If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement,” he said. He chastised advocates for self-treatment. “You’re going to self-diagnose treatment of addiction? There’s no a magic bullet for addiction. People from addiction clinics have said people do get addicted to Kratom. You should be working hand in hand with a health-care provider.”\n\nEven regarding the potential submission of Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient,” he explained that the substance, “has to show baseline acute safety, they have to do a toxicity study…and the extra-curricular question is: is it addictive.” In his view, that question is essential. If we do place preference studies for things that sweeten our coffee, why wouldn’t we do that for Kratom?\n\nFabricant comes across as passionate and sincere about his position. It’s worth noting, however, that some of the NPA’s member companies make and sell products that compete with Kratom (such as “At Ease” and “Brain Awakening,” and formulas for clear thinking or muscle spasms and tension) and would have an interest in how the botanical is regulated.\n\n“It’s more likely that it’s a fear held by the dietary companies,” said Charles Haddow, a representative from the American Kratom Association, “that if it’s as bad people are saying, that there will be a spillover that affects the division…if there are deaths, that it might bring calls to Congress calling for a new regulatory scheme for the industry.”\n\nStill, it’s not as if the Kratom importers and retailers don’t have financial interests at stake in this regulatory battle. “People supporting Kratom are making a lot of money, but they chastise makers of opiates for the same,” Fabricant pointed out. And research to ensure Kratom’s safety costs money, as the CEO acknowledged. But he insisted the Kratom industry isn’t stepping up and taking responsibility in that regard.\n\nChief Opponents Include Competing Substance Companies\n\nIn July of 2013, three organizations—the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, and the United Natural Products Alliance—sent a letter to the FDA expressing concern over Kratom’s lack of regulation. It certainly seems concern from the pharmaceutical and supplement industries triggered the FDA’s interest in Kratom. The FDA’s database reveals no documents about Kratom until a September 2014 news release regarding a Kratom seizure in southern California, and all the firms on the list of products Subject to Detention without Physical Examination under the import alert have dates published 2014 or after.\n\nCross-referencing the members listed for each organization with a 2012 report on narcotics manufacturers from United Nation’s Office of Drugs and Crime, it is revealed that the Council for Responsible Nutrition represents the pharmaceutical companies BASF, which manufactures the psychoactive stimulants cathine and methcathinone, and the opiate painkiller Tilidine; DSM Nutritional Products, which manufactures Bromazepam, Clonazepam, and Diazepam; and Lonza Inc., which makes the depressant GHB and methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat ADHD.\n\nThese drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its ‘perks,’ such as focus and energy.\n\nCHPA represents Chattem Chemicals (a division of Sun Pharma), which manufactures codeine, fentanyl, methadone, morphone, oxycodone, sufentanil; and Purdue Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of OxyContin. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also a member through their division “Teva Women’s Health”; Teva makes a generic for Actiq, a drug containing fentanyl, as well as oxycodone tablets.\n\nThe UNPA represents companies on the natural side of the industry, including Indena USA, which makes extracts from plants like chamomile and Devil’s Claw (used to treat muscle and back pain and migraines), and Morinda, which sells “natural” products, including energy drinks and focus supplements. These drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its “perks,” such as focus and energy.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies are heavyweights: BASF is No. 94 on Forbes’ list of the world’s biggest companies, and in 2015 its nutrition and health products generated 2.1 billion. Purdue generates about $3 billion in revenue annually, mostly from OxyContin sales. Chattem’s parent company, Sun Pharma, brought in about $403 million from U.S. sales in 2013.\n\nWhy wouldn’t these companies monetize the herb themselves instead of pushing for a ban? I asked Turner. Certainly their R&D budgets could create a Kratom product superior to a bitter green powder shipped to consumers in unmarked Ziploc bags or sold as powder capsules in head shops.\n\nLarge pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market.\n\nYet the number of alkaloids in the Kratom leaf (37, according to Fabricant, but sources differ) and their short shelf life once extracted would make manufacturing a synthetic version quite difficult. Even if such companies were selling simple extracts or powder capsules, Turner explained, it would take decades to grow a commercially viable domestic crop, and in the necessary tropical climates like Hawaii or Guam. Large-scale importation would be expensive to start up, too, especially with pre-existing regulatory barriers: the FDA would first need to approve Kratom as a safe dietary ingredient.\n\nTo complicate matters, regulators might require Kratom sellers to change the formulation to sell kratom products as supplements. According to Fabricant, that would mean they’d have to make an extract without the “addictive” main alkaloids. This would be another expensive step, and might render the product impotent.\n\nSo large pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market. Prescription narcotics bring in significant revenue. Pain medications are a $24 billion global market and Kratom’s position as a more tolerable and effective analgesic for many cuts in on the market.\n\nDespite the DEA’s scheduling halt, the FDA has already ordered more seizures of products containing Kratom this year.\n\nWhat About Approval Through the FDA?\n\nThe agencies that regulate what Americans put into their bodies operate on the assumption that anything that is not scientifically proven safe, to varying degrees of satisfaction as determined by the agencies, must be dangerous. As such, it would be more challenging for drug companies to convince the FDA that Kratom is safe, versus convincing them it is dangerous enough to ban.\n\nWhen attempting to enter the market, government agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise. Hence the lengthy clinical trials and years-long waits for FDA approval. To draw a comparison to criminal court: the drug (or dietary supplement) is guilty until proven innocent.\n\nGovernment agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise.\n\nNow, for experimental drugs synthesized in a lab, this makes a great deal of sense. Its potential effects are unknown, or close to it, and to immediately bottle it up and sell it to sick people would be preposterous. The length and breadth of the clinical trials may be up for debate, but testing isn’t just responsible, it’s an ethical obligation.\n\nBut Kratom isn’t an experimental drug, and its effects aren’t unknown. Its psychoactive nature may make some doctors and regulators nervous, but the plant has been used for centuries, and people are using it currently with overwhelmingly positive results.\n\nThe regulatory overseers, however, aren’t satisfied with history and anecdotes. Kratom sellers haven’t supplied the toxicity and place preference studies the FDA would want. Other scientific research is preliminary, but university research indicates Kratom’s main alkaloid, mitragynine, could indeed provide an effective “step-down” from opiate addiction.\n\nBut government science gets it wrong often enough to warrant serious doubts about its competence in regulating, or even advising, on our behaviors and consumption. Consider that it took the National Institute of Health nearly a decade to reverse guidelines on peanut allergies in children after the first studies challenging the wisdom of their approach were published, or the inflated place of dairy in both the old food pyramid and the new “myPlate” guidelines, or the fact that the FDA has set new sodium guidelines for food companies, despite strong evidence that sodium really isn’t all that harmful.\n\nHow About Aiming for Harm Reduction over Abstinence\n\nAbstinence is the chief principle governing the drug war that surrounds Kratom, leading to crackdowns on behaviors as mild as marijuana use, coming down hardest on the suppliers, but punishing users, too. One nurse of 26 years opined, somewhat hyperbolically, that if the DEA really wanted to make a difference, they would dispense Kratom to addicts “who want to get off that destructive merry go round.”\n\nAn agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose.\n\nFabricant believes “We didn’t get to have the safest food supply in the world by letting anyone dump something into the market just because they feel strongly about it.” But Turner is convinced it would be “detrimental to public health” to ban Kratom. To him, enforcing complete abstinence from a substance that is not well-researched in the lab, but that has been overwhelmingly beneficial in the real world, isn’t the answer.\n\n“The addicts have a true chance to get clean,” he said. “There are questions with Kratom, about dependency, but at the end of the day it’s not going to kill anybody.”\n\nThe vast regulatory state, with its lack of accountability to both legislators and the public, and its shared pool of expertise with the private sector it purports to regulate, is ripe for exploitation. An agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose. In the case of Kratom, many of those consumers are suffering and even more vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe fate of Kratom is still in limbo. But may the plant’s close brush with regulatory disaster be a lesson to citizens: the government doesn’t always hold our best interests as a top priority.\n\nGeorgi is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist and host of The 180 Cast , where she interviews people who have changed their minds on important political and social issues.

         "Sources: US enforcement of Iran arms embargo slipped during nuclear talks",
         "WASHINGTON - Addressing concerns that a landmark nuclear deal reached this year could boost Iran's military power, the Obama administration reassured critics that it would maintain and enforce its remaining tough sanctions against the country Yet the US government has pursued far fewer violations of a long-standing arms embargo against Iran in the past year compared to recent years, according to a review of court records and interviews with two senior officials involved in sanctions enforcement.The sharp fall in new prosecutions did not reflect fewer attempts by Iran to break the embargo, the officials said. Rather, uncertainty among prosecutors and agents on how the terms of the deal would affect cases made them reluctant to commit already scarce resources with the same vigor as in previous years, the officials said.\n\nStay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nThe more relaxed enforcement raises questions over how strictly the arms embargo and other remaining sanctions will be applied in future, since the nuclear deal still needs to be implemented and Iran will likely remain sensitive to a tough sanctions regime.In the 2014-15 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, US law enforcement officials filed fresh charges just twice against those suspected of attempting to smuggle weapons and related technology from the United States to Iran, according to court records.Eight such cases were brought in 2013-14. By comparison, around 10 to 12 such cases were brought in each of the preceding six years.\"There's been a precipitous drop-off,\" said one of the senior US officials, who declined to be identified. \"The facts are the facts - there's no other explanation.\"The official added there was already a \"reticence\" in some agencies and US federal prosecutors' offices to pursue the cases because they are so tough to build and time-consuming.\"And if we're going to normalize things with Iran soon, people are asking, 'Is it worth it?'\"The nuclear deal, reached in July after two years of concerted negotiations, tasks Iran with dismantling much of its nuclear infrastructure in return for the removal of many of the international sanctions placed on it over the past five years.The US sanctions being lifted are largely nuclear-related measures that barred other countries from dealing with Iran's banking and oil sectors.US sanctions for Iran's alleged human rights violations and support for militant groups remain in place, as do measures barring US persons from most trade with Iran. A United Nations embargo on conventional weapons will be lifted in five years, and a UN embargo on ballistic missiles in eight.Multiple US laws and regulations still bar the export of US goods and technology to Iran, especially anything related to defense.Obama administration officials say they continued to aggressively enforce sanctions against Iran throughout the negotiations, are still doing so, and will strictly enforce the remaining sanctions after the deal is implemented.\"The Justice Department continues to pursue criminal prosecutions against those that seek to circumvent US sanctions involving Iran and other export controls,\" said Marc Raimondi, a spokesman for the department, adding there were numerous ongoing cases.A senior Commerce Department official said its Office of Export Enforcement \"continues to vigorously enforce sanctions on Iran\" and that Iran cases make up the bulk of its current file.A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a Department of Homeland Security agency, did not respond to a request for comment.Elizabeth Bourassa, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said the department had enforced sanctions at the same pace since a framework deal was announced with Iran in April as it did in the preceding year and a half.Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) enforces a wide variety of sanctions beyond non-proliferation, including financial, terrorism, and oil measures.\"Since the start of the negotiating period, OFAC imposed sanctions on more than 100 Iran-related individuals and entities, concluded more than 20 Iran-related enforcement actions, and assessed approximately $525 million in penalties for violations of Iran-related sanctions,\" Bourassa said.",

         "McConnell Would Fill Potential Supreme Court Vacancy In 2020, Reversal Of 2016 Stance\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIn 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to hold a hearing on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, saying that it was an election year and that the American people \"deserved a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nThat was then.\n\nSpeaking to an audience in Kentucky on Monday, McConnell said should a vacancy occur on the court in 2020, another presidential election year, he would allow a vote.\n\nHe was asked at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon: \"Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMcConnell responded with a grin, \"Oh, we'd fill it.\"\n\nThe comments were first reported by CNN.\n\nMcConnell has made similar pronouncements in the past, noting that the nomination of Merrick Garland by Obama came during a time of divided government and that should a vacancy occur with President Trump in the White House and the Senate also under GOP control, circumstances would be different.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to McConnell on Twitter, calling him \"a hypocrite\"\n\nMcConnell's office argued Wednesday morning that his comments were not inconsistent.\n\n\"The Leader has noted on multiple occasions that not since the 1880s has a 'vacancy created in a presidential year' been 'confirmed by the party opposite the occupant of the White House.' His comments in Paducah yesterday simply repeated this. If there is a vacancy next year, because the White House and the Senate are the same party, we would vote to fill the slot,\" McConnell's staff director wrote in an email to reporters listing previous statements.\n\nIn his remarks to the luncheon on Tuesday, McConnell stressed the importance he places on putting conservatives in judgeships, even more than legislative accomplishments.\n\n\"What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\" McConnell said. \"That's the most important thing we've done for the country, which cannot be undone.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere are two justices on the high court who are in their 80s, and Democrats have worried for some time about the health of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. By denying Garland a seat, McConnell has assured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a foreseeable future, with the confirmations of Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and of Brett Kavanaugh last year.",

He passed a background check to work at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nCNN —\n\nAn accused war criminal living in the United States is now working as a security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nA CNN investigation found that Yusuf Abdi Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities while he was a military commander during Somalia’s brutal civil war, has been living a quiet life near the nation’s capital for about 20 years.\n\nHe is just one of more than 1,000 accused war criminals living and working in the United States.\n\nMass graves and haunting stories\n\nCourtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Mass grave reveals Somalia's bloody past Prev Next\n\nIn a shallow pit in northern Somalia, forensic anthropologists have been delicately digging around battered bones that were recently found in numerous mass graves. They’re the remains of a clan slaughtered during the war in the 1980s, alleged evidence of the brutality carried out by the government regime in power at the time.\n\nLed by Mohamed Siad Barre, the regime took over Somalia after a coup in 1969 and ruled with an iron fist. In the north, the dominant Isaaq clan was heavily repressed and brutalized by government forces, according to human rights experts.\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali served as a commander in the Barre regime and is accused of terrorizing the Isaaq people, torturing clan members, burning villages and conducting mass executions.\n\nSeveral villagers described these atrocities in a documentary that aired on the Canadian network CBC in 1992. One witness claimed Ali captured and killed a family member.\n\n“He tied (my brother) to military vehicle and dragged him behind. He said to us if you’ve got enough power, get him back,” the villager said. “He shredded him into pieces. That’s how he died.”\n\nCNN found that, today, Ali is living a normal suburban life just outside of the nation’s capital, in Alexandria, VA. He shares an apartment with his wife and works as a security guard at Dulles, one of the busiest airports in the country.\n\nAs a result of CNN’s investigation, Ali has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nSomali President Mohamed Siad Barre in May 1990. MIKE NELSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAli’s employer Master Security has a contract with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to provide unarmed security services. Ali passed a “full, federally mandated vetting process” that included an FBI background check and a TSA assessment.\n\nHowever, when CNN initially asked Master Security about Ali, the company said it was “unaware of the pending litigation.”\n\nIn light of the “very serious nature of the allegations,” Ali is on administrative leave, and the company is reviewing the case, according to Chief Executive Rick Cucina. Ali’s airport access has also been withdrawn.\n\nThe case against Ali\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali\n\nAli is being sued in a U.S. civil court. The lawsuit, which a human rights group initially filed in 2006, calls Ali a “war criminal” who committed “crimes against humanity.”\n\n“He oversaw some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine,” said Kathy Roberts, an attorney for the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), which is leading the civil suit. “He tortured people personally; he oversaw torture.”\n\nThe case has had numerous twists and appeals over the years. The most recent happened in February, when the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only part of the case can move forward – the lawsuit’s claims that Ali tortured and attempted to murder the plaintiff. The other part of the suit – claims that he committed “war crimes” – cannot because those alleged crimes happened outside of the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to hear it, it could become a landmark case over whether foreigners living in the U.S. can be held accountable for crimes allegedly committed overseas.\n\nRoberts claims Ali is directly responsible for these atrocities, painting disturbing images of acts he allegedly committed.\n\nRebels of Somali National Movement (SNM) sit on their beds in November 1989 in Leila, northern Somalia. ALEXANDER JOE/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“He arrested people, stole their stuff, burned villages, executed masses of people,” Roberts said. “At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nAli and his lawyer, Joseph Peter Drennan, deny all accusations listed in the CJA lawsuit.\n\nWhen CNN approached Ali outside his apartment in Alexandria, he declined an interview, telling correspondent Kyra Phillips: “To tell you the truth, all is false. Baseless.”\n\n“How dare anyone call him a war criminal,” Drennan told CNN. “Those are just allegations. If he is indeed a war criminal, take him to The Hague. Or if he is a war criminal, take it up with the immigration authorities. Don’t sue him in an American court… My client deserves to live in the U.S. just as any other legal permanent resident.”\n\nHowever, there is no criminal court in the world that can try Ali for war crimes. One key reason for this is that no criminal court really has jurisdiction to do so.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague wasn’t formally envisioned until 1994, following the genocide in Rwanda. The ICC didn’t issue its first arrest warrants until a decade later.\n\n“At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nOther special war crimes or genocide tribunals, such as those in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Cambodia, were only created for the specific areas where those crimes took place. Somalia has never been able to develop a complete justice system that could embark on such a tribunal.\n\nThe U.S. doesn’t have jurisdiction over the events that played out in Somalia in the 1980s, even though Ali has ties to the U.S. military. At the time, the Siad Barre government was a U.S. ally. Thus, American officials considered many military soldiers and commanders, including Ali, to be fighting for U.S. interests.\n\nDrennan asks: If the Defense Department had no problem with Ali, why should anyone else?\n\n“My client has never been adjudicated to have committed any wrongful acts of any sort, much less be correctly seen as a war criminal,” Drennan said. “He is not a war criminal.”\n\nThe U.S. government says its investigators have been aware of Ali for years, “based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, officials refused to provide further details.\n\nThe suspected war criminals among us\n\nAli is just one of many people who are living in the United States despite being accused of committing some of the worst violence in modern times.\n\nThese people – most of whom are men – are accused of crimes such as mass murder in El Salvador; torture and murder in Chile; ethnic cleansing in Somalia. Some are even wanted in their homelands, with outstanding extradition requests to remove them from the U.S. so they can be held accountable for their crimes.\n\nYet they continue to lead typical American lives, with some even working jobs in high-profile positions.\n\n“There’s about 1,000 suspected perpetrators in the United States,” Roberts said.\n\nRoberts and CJA say Americans should know that accused war criminals and suspected human rights violators are living across the country.\n\n“It fundamentally violates what we could call American values,” Roberts said. “But I really would rather say human values – to allow people like this to get off scot-free, and to allow them to benefit from the rule of law that they deprived their victims of, and they need to be held accountable.”\n\nAli ended up in Canada after the Barre military regime collapsed in 1991. But he was deported several years later after news about his alleged war crimes in Somalia became public through the CBC documentary.\n\nAli entered the U.S. on a visa through his Somali wife, Intisar Farah, who became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, she was found guilty of naturalization fraud for claiming she was a refugee from the very Somali clan that Ali is accused of torturing.\n\nFrom Somalia to Dulles\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali, working security at Dulles International Airport. CNN\n\nDrennan said there should be no concerns whatsoever that Ali was working at an airport. Roberts, however, disagrees.\n\n“It’s very deeply disturbing, in part because that is a position of trust,” she said. “He abused that authority terribly in Somalia, and while I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\n“… While I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials declined to comment on Ali’s case, or on other alleged war criminals, but they did confirm that he was known to the agency.\n\nIn a statement ICE wrote: “Yusuf Ali came to the attention of investigators and attorneys within the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, ICE’s legacy agency, based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, ICE officials would not clarify why Ali has been allowed to remain in the U.S.\n\nIn the last 12 years, ICE’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center has arrested more than 360 people “for human rights-related violations.” The agency has also removed more than 780 known or suspected human rights violators from the U.S. It currently has more than 125 active investigations.",

         "Story highlights NEW: Multiple officials identify the shooter as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer Ten people were killed and another seven were injured, sheriff says Thoughts and prayers are \"not enough,\" says President Barack Obama\n\nCNN —\n\n[Breaking news update 11:38 p.m. ET]\n\nThe gunman who opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College targeted Christians specifically, according to the father of a wounded student.\n\nBefore going into spinal surgery, Anastasia Boylan told her father and brother the gunman entered her classroom firing. The professor in the classroom was shot point blank. Others were hit, she told her family.\n\nEveryone in the classroom dropped to the ground.\n\nThe gunman, while reloading his handgun, ordered the students to stand up if they were Christians, Boylan told her family.\n\n“And they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,’” Boylan’s father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account.\n\n“And then he shot and killed them.”\n\n[Last update posted at 11:28 p.m. ET]\n\n(CNN ) – Ten people were killed when a gunman opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College on Thursday, forcing the nation to face yet another mass shooting.\n\nSeven other people were injured, and the shooter is dead, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters. Earlier estimates had put the number of people hurt much higher.\n\nMultiple law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Investigators have interviewed members of his family and friends, they said.\n\n“I will not name the shooter,” Hanlin said. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought.”\n\nAuthorities credited a quick response by law enforcement for keeping the death toll from climbing higher.\n\nA law enforcement official said the shooter had body armor with him and was heavily armed, with a large amount of ammunition – enough for a prolonged gunfight.\n\nHanlin said tactical teams and bomb squads had cleared the buildings on campus and were working to clear hundreds of vehicles parked on campus.\n\nHuddled together\n\nCassandra Welding is a student at the Roseburg campus and was in class when the shooting started.\n\n“I heard a popping noise, almost like a balloon popping,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I knew something wasn’t right and so I get down.”\n\nShe said all of the students in her classroom dropped to the ground. They huddled together behind backpacks and chairs, underneath tables.\n\n“We locked the doors, turned off the lights, and we were all pretty much in panic mode,” Welding said.\n\n“We called 911 and called our parents, our loved ones … We didn’t know what was going to happen, if those were our last words or not.”\n\nCommunity members attend a candlelight vigil at Stewart Park for those killed during a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday, October 1. The massacre left nine people dead and nine wounded. The gunman also died.

Aaron Yost/The News-Review/AP Shooting at Oregon community college Prev Next\n\nThe shooting\n\nThe shooting appears to have started in one building before the gunman moved to the school’s science building, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Those killed and wounded were found in at least two classrooms.\n\n“We arrived to find multiple patients in multiple classrooms. Law enforcement was on scene and had the shooter neutralized,” said Douglas County Fire Marshal Ray Shoufler.\n\nHe told CNN that two patients died while being transported to a hospital.\n\nMercy Medical Center posted on Facebook that it had received 10 patients. The extent of their injuries was not known.\n\nThree female victims were at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield, according to a hospital spokeswoman.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear why the hospitals’ numbers conflicted with the figure provided by Sheriff Hanlin.\n\nA law enforcement official told CNN three pistols and one rifle believed to have belonged to the suspect were recovered at the scene.\n\nATF agents were also on scene and canine teams were en route to search for explosives, fire arms casings and ammunition, a spokesman said. FBI agents were en route.\n\nThe community\n\nRoseburg is a city of about 22,000 people about 70 miles south of Eugene, Oregon, and some 180 miles south of Portland.\n\nThe school itself is up on a hill outside the city center, according to Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst who lives nearby. Francona said that logging is a big industry in the region, which is fairly rural but easily accessible from Interstate 5.\n\nOregon shooting shatters ‘peaceful’ enclave\n\n“This is so out of character for this whole area,” he said.\n\nNews of the shooting quickly reached Washington, with the state’s senior senator, Ron Wyden, visibly shaken and Sen. Jeff Merkley tweeting that he was praying for the victims and their families.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation and will continue to receive updates throughout the day.\n\nHe pushed for a change in gun laws when he spoke to reporters about the shooting Thursday.\n\n“Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this,” he said.\n\nThe President continued: “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America – next week, or a couple months from now.”\n\nThe school\n\nA picturesque campus in the North Umpqua River Valley, Umpqua Community College prides itself on a “a peaceful, safe atmosphere, and year-round recreational activities,” according to its website.\n\nIt’s not a traditional institution of higher learning, as the average age of its 13,600 students was 38 during the 2013-2014 school year. Only 740 of those were full time, 2,437 were part time and more than 10,000 fell under the umbrella of “community education.”\n\nIt first began teaching classes out of rented facilities in 1961. Elton and Ruth Jackson donated 98.5 acres to house the campus in 1965.\n\nThe school will be closed until Monday as a result of the shooting.\n\nThe interim leader of Umpqua Community College called Thursday “the saddest day in the history of the college.”\n\nAre you there?

         "Calling Nurse A 'Hero,' Utah Hospital Bars Police From Patient-Care Areas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP\n\nUpdated 8:35 p.m. ET\n\nThe Salt Lake City hospital where a police officer roughly arrested a nurse who was protecting her patient's rights in July will no longer allow law enforcement agents inside its patient care areas. They'll now have to check in rather than enter through the emergency room.\n\n\"Law enforcement who come to the hospital for any reason involving patients will be required to check in to the front desk of the hospital,\" said chief nursing officer Margaret Pearce of the University of Utah Hospital. \"There, a hospital house supervisor will meet the officers to work through each request.\"\n\nHospital officials say they created the policy one day after the July incident in which nurse Alex Wubbels refused to allow a police investigator identified as Jeff Payne to get a blood sample from a patient who was injured in a deadly collision with another driver. Wubbels was following the hospital's policy (and a recent Supreme Court decision) that requires either a warrant, the patient's consent or the patient being under arrest for such a sample to be obtained legally.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment bars blood tests from being obtained without a warrant in drunken-driving cases.\n\n\"Our hospital continues to offer our full support to Alex,\" said Gordon Crabtree, the hospital system's CEO. \"I think many of you know she is an Olympian, and to us she's truly an Olympic-size hero. We extend our appreciation for her dedication and service.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile Wubbels' superiors said she had shown professional integrity and grace under fire, the officer's bosses and Salt Lake City's mayor have issued apologies for his behavior. He is on administrative leave while the case is being investigated.\n\nThe encounter between Wubbels and Payne took place on July 26 — but it made headlines last Thursday, when body camera footage of the dispute was released. The video shows Wubbels referring to her hospital's privacy policy and speaking with a supervisor on her cellphone as she denies the officer's request for a blood sample from a patient.\n\nHaving failed to persuade Wubbels to allow him to obtain blood from the patient, the officer begins grabbing at the nurse and then forcefully pulls her outside the hospital as she yells for help. He then handcuffs her and puts her in a police car parked at the hospital.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Our team was advocating for the immediate release of Alex and was ultimately successful in getting her released from the handcuffs and the car,\" Crabtree said on Monday. \"Alex was never charged and will not have a record.\"\n\nOther hospitals will very likely want to adopt similar policies to prevent police overreach, Crabtree said.\n\nPearce said she was \"appalled\" at the encounter. She added:\n\n\"We are a Level 1 Trauma Center with the only dedicated burn unit in the Mountain West region and we have some of the sickest patients anywhere. Because of this, we work with law enforcement on a regular basis for a variety of reasons and will continue to do so. However, I consider the way in which Alex was treated to be totally unacceptable. No individual in a role of patient care should ever be treated in this fashion.\"\n\nThe new policy \"was written the day after this incident\" and was implemented within weeks, Pearce said. Here's how she described the goals for the change:\n\nAllow front-line patient care staff to focus on their work.\n\nPrevent disputes from taking place inside patient care units.\n\nEnsure only \"highly trained people\" work through such issues.\n\nAs we've reported, Wubbels is a former two-time Olympic skier.\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department says it suspended Payne from its \"blood draw program,\" in which it trains officers to take blood samples. It adds that it updated its policies for officers who remain in the group.\n\nPayne has also been fired from his part-time paramedic job with a private ambulance service.\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake City Tribune, the patient in question was truck driver William Gray — who also works as a reserve police officer in Rigby, Idaho, and whose tractor-trailer collided with a vehicle that was being pursued by police.\n\nCiting Payne's police report, the Tribune describes the highway crash that led to the hospital confrontation:\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"At about 2 p.m. on July 26, Gray was driving a semi north on State Road 89/91 near Sardine Canyon when a man fleeing from the Utah Highway Patrol crashed a pickup truck into him head-on, according to Logan police, who investigated the collision.\n\n\"The crash caused an explosion and fire, Logan police have said. Gray was on fire when he exited the semi. The driver of the pickup truck, Marcos Torres, 26, died at the scene.\"",

         "Mary Bowerman, USA TODAY Network\n\nA Florida woman who believes the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting is a hoax was arrested Monday on charges she threatened the parent of a child killed in the 2012 school shooting.\n\nLucy Richards, 57, of Tampa, Fla., was indicted on four counts of transmitting threats, according to a statement from the United States Attorney Southern District of Florida.\n\nThe Sandy Hook shooting is approaching its fourth anniversary. On Dec. 14, 2012, 20 children and six school staffers were fatally shot at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. By Adam Lanza, 20. Lanza later fatally shot himself.\n\nAccording to authorities, Richards made a series of death threats against Len Pozner, the parent of a child who was killed in the shooting.\n\nSandy Hook mom sent this message to Orlando victims\n\nRichards is accused of telling the parent “you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon,\" according to federal court documents. The statements were made in January. She also wrote, \"Look behind you it's death,\" according to the documents.\n\nPozner addressed Richards' arrest in a statement.\n\n\"We are comforted to know that the system is working to protect the victims of violent crime from re-victimization by potentially violent Hoaxers,\" Pozner said.\n\nIf convicted of all four counts, Richards could face up to 20 years in prison. She is scheduled to appear in a Fort Lauderdale court on Dec. 19.\n\nMr. Trump, denounce Alex Jones: Sandy Hook principal's daughter\n\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman",

         "News Articles On ‘Child Suicide Game’ Targeting Vulnerable Parents Share:\n\nVULNERABLE parents as young as 15 are being warned of the dangers of ‘clickbait’ style news articles designed to spread fear and panic around a self-harming game called ‘Momo’, WWN can confirm.\n\nExperts have warned children that the majority of the news articles depict an image of a distorted woman with sensational headlines and can lure parents into a state of panic in a matter of seconds.\n\n“If you see your parent reading such articles please reassure them that everything is going to be okay,” said chief executive of WebSafe Ireland, Thomas Jockey. “Parents may go temporarily insane and start searching through your devices and there may also be a period of time that your YouTube app will be deleted in exchange for the Kids YouTube app, but don’t worry; this is only temporary”.\n\nThe articles, which have now gone more viral than the game they’re covering thus exposing millions of children to something they had never heard of before, feature across all mainstream media platforms and are more or less worded in the same scaremongering style and come with thousands of naive comments from parents.\n\n“I caught my mother searching through my iPad and had to have ‘the talk’ with her,” explains 7-year-old Saoirse Hogan from Lucan, “once you explain that you’re not that stupid as to go harm yourself over a stupid game, then they seem to calm down a bit,” adding, “Sure God bless their cotton socks, if they only knew the real life stuff online we’d be watching, they’d actually have reason to be scared”.",

         "3 Californias? The initiative to break up the state may be on the ballot in November",
         "CNN —\n\nShould the country’s most populous state be split into three separate states? California voters might be able to make that decision this fall.\n\nA local venture capitalist’s proposal to break up California, “CAL 3,” gained nearly double the necessary signatures to get it on the ballot in November, which will allow state voters to decide on the partition.\n\nTim Draper announced Thursday that his initiative had gotten more than 600,000 signatures from registered voters across all of the state’s 58 counties, surpassing the 365,880 signatures required by state law.\n\n“This is an unprecedented show of support on behalf of every corner of California to create three state governments that emphasize representation, responsiveness, reliability and regional identity,” Draper said.\n\nHow could this help California?\n\nAccording to the proposal, first announced in November, this will solve California’s most pressing issues, including the state’s failing school systems, high taxes, deteriorating infrastructure and strained government.\n\nDraper explained that partitioning California into three states would empower regional communities to make better and more sensible decisions for their citizens.\n\n“To create three states from a standing start, you’ll get all the benefits of knowing all the things that worked in the past, and all the things that could work in the future and you get to eliminate all the baggage you got in the state,” Draper said in a news conference Thursday night at Draper University.\n\n“When you get together and you start something fresh, you have a new way to look at it and create better things” he added.\n\nThe 3 smaller states\n\nDraper also suggests that California citizens would be better served by three smaller state governments while preserving the historic boundaries of the various counties, cities and towns.\n\nCalifornia: This will be considered the new state which includes Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey and San Benito counties.\n\nSouthern California: San Diego, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, Mono, Madera, Inyo, Tulare, Fresno, Kings, Kern and Imperial counties.\n\nNorthern California: This would include the Bay Area and the 31 remaining counties north of Sacramento.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nDraper says CAL 3 will deliver the 600,000 signatures to the secretary of state next week and the signatures will then have to be vetted and approved.\n\nCNN reached out to Secretary of State Alex Padilla, but he refused to comment until he receives the signatures.\n\nIf the measure is approved by voters, the governor will transfer the notice of state approval to Congress, which will\n\nvote to ratify the creation of the new three-state structure.\n\nConstitutional lawyer and professor Jonathan Turley told CNN that congressional approval is not impossible, but not likely to happen, as Democrats could feel they have too much to lose.\n\n“Dems consider California to be a single golden empire, it would be hard for them to accept it as three golden empires.”\n\nTurley explained that with the creation of two new states, this would likely add four new members to the US Senate, something that could create endless tensions between representatives.\n\nDraper backed a proposal to turn California into six states in 2014 but it failed to get the required number of signatures to qualify, and the measure was not presented to voters in the 2016 polls.",

         "NIMRUD, IRAQ—Popping open a bottle of champagne and dancing with a mummified corpse in celebration, Smithsonian Institution archeologist Dr. Kathleen Roberts confessed she was “excited as all hell” Thursday after “hitting the mass grave jackpot” in northern Iraq. “Booyah! I mean, seriously, fuck yeah—we’re rolling in bones, baby,” said Roberts, throwing handfuls of Holocene-era rib bones into the air and standing under the confetti-like cascade of osseous chips. “Rang-a-dang, suckers! This is why I got into the business. I mean, you hear about people hitting the burial site lottery like this, but you never think it’s going to happen to you. There must be a 10-foot layer of bones down there! We got warrior bones, kids’ bones, skeletons of virgins tied to stakes. It must have been an absolute bloodbath. Truly horrific. I’m gonna be stinking rich! No more trying to get excited about a body here or a possible sacrifice there. Just goes to show, you gotta keep playing to win though.” Roberts then stripped to her underwear, lustily rubbed her hands together, and dove headfirst into the staggering assemblage of scientifically significant ancient remains.",

         "UT/TT Poll: Texas voters feeling high anxiety over election security",
         "Voters in the party that has not lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994 are most likely to say that elections are fraught with criminality, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.\n\nThe findings echo Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s “rigged election” theme and rising apprehension over foreign or criminal hackers.\n\nRepublicans, who have won every statewide election in Texas for the past two decades, were more likely than independents and much more likely than Democrats to say that “people voting who are not eligible” will be an “extremely serious” or “somewhat serious” problem in this year’s elections.\n\nNine of 10 Republicans said ineligible voters voting would be a serious problem, 69 percent of independents said so and only 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Three-quarters of the Democrats rated the problem “not too serious” or “not serious at all.”\n\nAmong the Republican voters, 70 percent ranked the problem as “extremely serious.”\n\n“Wow,” said Daron Shaw, co-director of the poll and a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, after looking over the results. “To me, it’s an indication of how unhappy people are with the system, how deeply they believe it is corrupt and incompetent.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe same pattern held true when they were asked about people voting multiple times. Overwhelming numbers of Republican likely voters — 83 percent — said that will be a serious problem this year. Among independent voters, 61 percent agreed with that, but only 24 percent of Democrats think multiple voting will be a serious problem.\n\n“This is one of these showcase results where you have to ask the chicken-and-egg question about Republican attitudes in Texas and what Donald Trump seems to have wrought — but might just be plugging into,” said Jim Henson, who heads the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin and co-directs the poll. “Republicans nationally, but also in Texas, have been stoking worries about the election process in the absence of any systematic evidence of any real problems.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe party lines blur a bit when voters are asked about “votes being counted inaccurately.” Three quarters of self-identified Republican and independent voters think that will be a serious concern this year, and 45 percent of Democrats agree with them.\n\nAnd the lines fade more when it comes to “voting machines being hacked into by a foreign government or other bad actor.” That one got a serious ranking from 66 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of independents and 55 percent of Democrats.\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 14 to Oct. 23 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points. Among likely voters — those who said either that they are certain to vote or that they have voted in “every” recent election — the margin of error is +/- 3.16 percentage points (n=959). Numbers in charts might not add up to 100 percent because of rounding.\n\nThis is one of several stories on the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. Yesterday: The race for president. Also today: What Texas voters think about various state and federal officeholders and institutions.\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.

         "Phil Murphy beats Kim Guadagno to succeed Christie as N.J. governor",
         "TRENTON -- Phil Murphy, a former Wall Street executive and diplomat with no previous elected experience but deep pockets and strong ties to the Democratic Party, easily defeated Republican Kim Guadagno Tuesday to succeed Chris Christie as New Jersey's governor.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, with 99 percent of districts reporting, Murphy led Guadagno by about 13 percentage points -- 55.4 percent to 42.5 percent, according to the Associated Press. Murphy was ahead by nearly 250,000 voters -- 1.12 million to 859,000.\n\nCNN, ABC, and NBC projected Murphy the victory around 8 p.m. Tuesday, almost immediately after the polls closed. The projection was based on exit polling and was an indicator the race would not be close.\n\nMurphy's victory over Guadagno, Christie's lieutenant governor, will usher in a new era of Democratic rule in the Garden State after eight years of Christie, a once-popular Republican who saw his approval rating plummet to historic lows in recent years. Christie was prohibited by state law from running for a third consecutive term.\n\nMurphy, 60, will become the first Democrat in the governor's office since Jon Corzine, another former Goldman Sachs executive who spent millions of his own money to win the seat in 2005 but lost re-election to Christie in 2009.\n\nWhen Murphy is sworn in as the state's 56th governor Jan. 16, Democrats will likely control both the governor's office and the state Legislature for the first time since Corzine's four-year term.\n\nAll legislative races have not been called yet, but Democrats will at least hold -- if not expand -- their control of both the state Senate and Assembly.\n\n\"Tonight, we declare the days of division over,\" Murphy said during his victory speech in Asbury Park. \"We will move forward together. ... We have each other's backs.\"\n\nMurphy -- a former U.S. ambassador to Germany -- will take over arguably the most powerful governor's seat in the nation, with the ability to line-item veto bills and the state budget and appoint state officials who are elected in other states.\n\nHe has promised to push New Jersey in a progressive direction, vowing to legalize and tax marijuana, institute a $15 minimum wage, tighten the state's already strict gun-control laws, and ramp up funding for education, public-worker pensions, and transportation, while protecting undocumented immigrants and fighting the agenda of President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nMurphy said Tuesday night that he will push back against \"the mean winds\" blowing out of Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This is one of the first major elections since Donald Trump was elected,\" he said. \"Tonight, New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation: We are better than this.\"\n\nMurphy will also bring a much different personality to the governor's office than Christie did. Whereas Christie made national headlines for his brash, often combative attitude, Murphy is more low-key and prone to smiling even when challenged.\n\nMurphy inherits a state with signifiant problems -- including the highest property taxes in the country, a troubled transportation system, and a public-worker pension system deeply in debt.\n\nFor Guadagno, the loss brings an end to her eight-year run in Trenton. With her association to Christie hanging on her like an albatross, Guadagno trailed Murphy by double digits in every poll and had a 3-to-1 fundraising disadvantage in a state where registered Democrats outnumber register Republicans by about 880,000.\n\nGuadagno, who was vying to become only the second woman governor in state history, lost even though she had cut into Murphy's lead in polls with an aggressive push before Election Day.\n\nGuadagno said during her concession speech that her campaign \"made the best case possible.\"\n\n\"We were fighting for our families and we will continue that fight for lower taxes and a safer New Jersey,\" she told the crowd in Aberdeen. \"This is not the end. ... We may have lost the battle, but we will win this war in the long run.\"\n\nNew Jersey was one of only two states in the U.S. with a governor's election Tuesday, along with Virginia.\n\nAnd though voters in the blue state were getting to choose Christie's replacement a year after Trump's election, the race largely inspired apathy among Jerseyans. Up until last week, polls showed more than half of likely voters knew little about Guadagno or Murphy.\n\nBut a Democrat -- Ralph Northam -- also won Virginia's race. And political experts Tuesday were already framing both elections as a repudiation of Trump's policies.\n\nTuesday's victory caps an unexpected journey to the Statehouse for Murphy, a Boston area native who was little known in the state before entering this race last year.\n\nMurphy gobbled up support from the Democratic Party chairs in key north Jersey counties to become the front-runner for the party's nomination, pushing aside expected candidates like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester.\n\nHe then spent $16 million of his own fortune en route to handily beating five primary opponents to snag the Democratic nomination.\n\nMurphy repeatedly linked Guadagno to Christie and promised to boost the state's economy, saying his time at Goldman Sachs taught him how to create jobs.\n\nGuadagno repeatedly linked Murphy to Corzine, calling him an out-of-touch multimillionaire liberal who would raise taxes in the state.\n\nMurphy plans to increase spending by $1.3 billion on education, pensions, and transportation by hiking taxes on wealthy residents, closing corporate tax loopholes, and taxing legal pot. He says the hikes would spare the middle class.\n\nHe also proposes instituting a state-run bank to help rev the economy.\n\nMurphy vows to battle Trump's policies in a diverse state where the president is deeply unpopular. He said during a debate that he would even consider making New Jersey a \"sanctuary state\" to protect some undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nGuadagno pounced on that, painting Murphy as being too soft on crime and releasing a controversial television ad that suggested he would even protect \"deranged murderers\" like Jose Carranza, an undocumented immigrant from Peru who was convicted of killing thee teens in Newark in 2007.\n\nMurphy and his supporters denounced the commercial as racist and deceitful. Visiting Edison to stump for Murphy, former Vice President Joe Biden called it \"the return of Willie Horton\" -- a reference to the infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race.\n\nPolitical experts said Guadagno appeared to be borrowing a page from Trump's far-right playbook to appeal to the GOP base in what was predicted to be a race with a record-low voter turnout.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nPolls showed that Guadagno was hurt by her connection to Christie, a one-time national Republican star and presidential contender whose approval ratings have dropped by nearly 50 percentage points over the last few years.\n\nAfter voting in Mendham on Tuesday morning, Christie rejected the idea that this race was a referendum on his two terms as governor.\n\n\"This is not an election about me,\" Christie said. \"I had my referendum. My referendum was four years ago.\"\n\nChristie said he voted for @KimGuadagnoNJ, and that he doesn't think 2017 is a referendum on his tenure pic.twitter.com/aBMOPMYVWq — Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017\n\nNew Jerseyans often pinball between electing Republicans and Democrats for governor. No Democratic governor has won re-election since Brendan Byrne did 40 years ago, in 1977.\n\nMurphy overcame his ties to Goldman Sachs, which had become a target of derision during last year's presidential race. He spent 23 years at the Wall Street firm, managing its Asian and German offices.\n\nHe and his wife, Tammy Murphy, donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party both locally and national over the years and he served as the finance chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2006 to 2009.\n\nPresident Barack Obama then chose Murphy to become America's ambassador to Germany, a post Murphy held until 2013.\n\nMurphy was bolstered over the last two months by campaign visits from a string of big-name Democrats -- including Obama, Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Al Gore. Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi, his friend and neighbor, also performed at a Murphy rally two days before Election Day.\n\nMurphy also had the support of dozens of labor unions, including the New Jersey Education Association and the Communication Workers of America.\n\nMurphy's lieutenant governor will be Sheila Oliver, a veteran member of the state Assembly from Essex County who was the first black woman to serve as Assembly speaker in state history.\n\nOliver also won re-election to her Assembly seat on Tuesday. But under state law, she will have to give up that post to serve as lieutenant governor.\n\nNJ Advance Media staff writers Matt Arco and Claude Brodesser-Akner contributed to this report.\n\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.

         "Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks",
         "Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks\n\nAlthough the past few years have been an incredibly powerful time for women’s rights, feminism has just suffered a pretty crushing setback: Tragically, this woman sucks.\n\nDevastating. This is not good news for the feminist cause.\n\nThe notion that all women are powerful queens who deserve the world sadly doesn’t even come close to applying to 28-year-old Sarah Baylor, whose boring hobbies, grating personality traits, and overall lack of positive attributes prove that some women can (and do) absolutely suck. Between the below-average work she does at her totally inconsequential job, the meandering anecdotes about owning a ferret she foists on unsuspecting acquaintances, and the fact that she honestly smells kind of bad, Sarah unfortunately does not bring a single thing to the table that would compel someone to fight for women’s rights on her behalf. It’s tough to imagine anyone getting behind a movement intended to empower someone as unpleasant to be around as this god-awful woman.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s difficult to extend any sisterly support to someone who sucks this much ass.\n\nThere’s no telling how far Sarah will set back the feminist cause over the course of her life, but her apparent commitment to using her bad personality to totally blow every personal and professional opportunity that comes her way suggests that she will continue giving women a bad name for the foreseeable future. Had Sojourner Truth known that one day a woman like Sarah would go through life without ever doing anything even marginally impressive—seriously, not even winning some kind of bogus “citizenship” award in elementary school—would she have bothered to fight for women’s rights in the first place? It’s hard to say.\n\nYikes. We can only imagine what kind of damage Sarah already done to feminism just by being her selfish, slovenly, and frankly horrible self. Here’s hoping the feminist agenda finds a way to prevail despite such an awful blight on the movement.",

There are also indications that the 28-year-old gunman communicated with at least one person who is currently being monitored as a potential terror suspect, the source said.\n\nFarook’s connection to the potential terror suspect may only be tangential, the source said, but the link suggests there may be a “deeper terror matrix” behind the San Bernardino shootings.\n\nBut Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), the ranking minority member of the House Intelligence Committee who has been briefed on the investigation, said Thursday that federal agents have yet to turn up evidence that Farook was “radicalized.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarook and Malik fired at least 65 shots when they stormed the conference room at the Inland Regional Center, where 75 to 80 people had gathered for a holiday potluck. Twelve of the 14 dead and 18 of the 21 injured were county employees, police said.\n\nHours later, they exchanged fire with police on San Bernardino streets, launching bullets into homes and terrifying residents.\n\nWhen they searched Farook and Malik’s home, police recovered a dozen pipe bombs, 2,000 9-millimeter handgun rounds, 2,500 .223-caliber assault rifle rounds and “hundreds of tools” that could have been used to make additional explosive devices, Burguan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the attack on the party, Farook and Malik used two assault rifles and two semiautomatic handguns, all of which were purchased legally, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nAs authorities continued to look into the backgrounds of the husband and wife responsible for America’s deadliest mass shooting since 2012, investigators and legislators from California to Washington, D.C., tried to understand what motivated the shooters.\n\nPolice have also said that Farook was involved in a dispute at the party for fellow employees of the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health shortly before the gunfire broke out.\n\n“We do know that the two individuals who were killed were equipped with weapons and appeared to have access to additional weaponry at their homes,” President Obama said Thursday. “But we don’t know why they did it. We don’t know at this point the extent of their plans. We do not know their motivations.”\n\nSchiff echoed those sentiments.\n\n“They’re not ready to draw conclusions, but looking at anyone they were involved with that could shed light on what their motivations were,” he said. “The FBI is chasing down leads foreign and domestic, and looking for any evidence of radicalization.”\n\nSan Bernardino shooting × On Now Inside the home of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik On Now Video: San Bernardino honors shooting victims at stadium vigil On Now Farook family lawyers discuss FBI's comments about attacker's Facebook post On Now FBI: San Bernardino shooting investigated as act of terrorism On Now San Bernardino resident expresses sorrow for victims On Now People attend vigil for shooting victims at San Manuel Stadium in San Bernardino On Now Inside a gun shop on the day of the shootings On Now What happened in San Bernardino, a timeline On Now Backlash against neighbor of San Bernardino shooters On Now Mothers talk about children's safety during San Bernardino shooting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a news conference Thursday, Burguan said the suspects had 1,400 assault rifle rounds and 200 handgun rounds in their car as they fled from police. The couple fired 76 rounds at officers during the shootout, and officers shot 380 rounds in return. Burguan said he believed the suspects shot first.\n\nDespite uncertainty about the motive, Burguan said the cache of weapons and ammunition found at the couple’s home suggests the shootings were preplanned.\n\nOne law enforcement source said investigators are trying to determine whether explosives left at the scene of the shooting were from a design found in Inspire magazine, the online publication of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The source noted that the design is easily accessible and doesn’t mean the attack was related to Al Qaeda. Police said the device included three pipe bombs attached to a remote-controlled device.\n\nFarook was born in Illinois, and had worked at the Health Department as an inspector for five years. Malik was born in Pakistan, according to a federal law enforcement source.\n\nFarook traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2013 during the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and also visited Saudi Arabia in July 2014 for nine days to pick up Malik and bring her to the United States on a K-1 fiance visa. Neither trip lasted very long, the official said. The official has seen no record of Farook traveling to Pakistan, as the assistant director for the FBI’s Los Angeles field office said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nFarook’s foreign travel didn’t raise the usual alarm bells with federal agencies because he didn’t spend several months overseas or travel to places where he could have spent a long period of time in a jihadist training camp, a senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalik applied for permanent residency on Sept. 30, 2014, and, after a background check by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, received a permanent resident green card in July 2015. The Saudi embassy in Washington had no records indicating that Malik was a Saudi citizen.\n\nPolice said they believe Farook and Malik were the only people directly involved in the shooting, but said the investigation was continuing.\n\nFederal investigators were attempting to interview three men who “were in phone contact” with Farook and his wife in the days leading up to the shooting rampage, a government official said.\n\nOne of the men that federal officials wanted to interview was Roshan Zamir Abbassi, who was born in Pakistan, according to a government source.\n\nAbbassi is an assistant imam at the Dal-Al-Uloom Al-Islamiyah of America mosque in San Bernardino, where Farook had regularly worshipped. Abbassi said he barely knew Farook, sharing only occasional hellos and goodbyes with him after prayers. Abbassi said he didn’t know Farook’s wife at all.\n\nAbbassi said he was confronted at gunpoint while at home Wednesday night by three officers, one of whom had a badge identifying him as a U.S. Secret Service agent, and was told they had phone records showing that Abbassi had been in contact with Farook at least 36 times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“But each of those could have been for only 10 seconds,” Abbassi told The Times on Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn fact, when Farook’s name surfaced as the alleged shooter, Abbassi said he didn’t initially recognize it, because he only knew Farook by his middle name, Rizwan.\n\nAbbassi posted a message about his run-in with the police Wednesday night on his Facebook page. Prior to that, the most recent item he shared was a video by Canadian poet Boona Mohammed condemning ISIS terrorism, but arguing that Western nations are equally guilty of attempting to achieve political and religious goals through violence, intimidation and fear.\n\n“I’m just condemning all forms of terrorism, whether it comes from someone with a Muslim background, or someone with a Christian background who shoots up an abortion clinic,” Abbassi said. The police did not ask about the views expressed in his social media feed, Abbassi said.\n\nAfter searching him to make sure he was unarmed, the officers holstered their weapons and questioned him for about an hour, Abbassi said.\n\nHe was not arrested or told he would be charged with a crime, Abbassi said.\n\nAbbassi said he is an American citizen, but was not born in the U.S. His parents brought him to this country when he was younger than 2 years old. Asked were his parents came from, he said, “I prefer to keep that private.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We are all against terrorism,” Abbassi said. “We all want peace.”\n\nOn Thursday morning, FBI agents and SWAT officers also raided a condominium in Corona, where they led away one man in handcuffs, neighbors said.\n\n“FBI agents with bullhorns showed up at 5 a.m.,” said Lorraine Otto, who lives next door to the home on Forum Way. “They kept saying, ‘This is the FBI. Open the door. If you don’t open the door, we’ll break it open.’”\n\nA federal law enforcement source told The Times that while investigators have yet to establish a clear motive in the shooting, they are leaning toward a possible “combination of terrorism and workplace” conflict.\n\nInvestigators also believe the couple had a familiarity with weapons and military-style tactics.\n\n“We want to know how they acquired that,” the source said.\n\nFarook and Malik were not known to federal investigators prior to the attack, the source said.\n\nShortly before the shooting, the couple left their young daughter with the child’s grandmother in Redlands, saying they had a doctor’s appointment, according to Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey headed to the regional center soon after.\n\nThe grandmother grew panicked when news of the shooting broke and began frantically calling Farook and Malik, but they did not answer, Ayloush said.\n\nFourteen people, all of them California residents, were killed in the gunfire.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Coroner’s office identified the slain victims late Thursday as: Shannon Johnson, 45, of Los Angeles; Bennetta Betbadal, 46, of Rialto; Aurora Godoy, 26, of San Jacinto; Issac Amanios, 60, of Fontana; Larry David Kaufman, 42, of Rialto; Harry Bowman, 46, of Upland; Yvette Velasco, 27, of Fontana; Sierra Clayborn, 27, of Moreno Valley; Robert Adams, 40, of Yucaipa; Nicholas Thalasinos, 52, of Colton; Tin Nguyen, 31, of Santa Ana; Juan Espinoza, 50, of Highland; Damian Meins, 58, of Riverside; and Michael Wetzel, 37, of Lake Arrowhead.\n\nThe shooting reignited the national debate over gun control. The president said Thursday that it was still too easy for people who want to kill large numbers of people to get access to high-powered weapons in the U.S.\n\n“We’re going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society to make sure that we can take basic steps that would make it harder, not impossible, but harder for individuals to get access to weapons,” Obama said.\n\nFarook and Malik used a pair of .223-caliber assault rifles and two semiautomatic handguns in the shooting, Burguan said.\n\nA federal law enforcement source told The Times that Farook purchased the pistols at Annie’s Get Your Gun, a firearms retailer in Corona that advertises itself as a “family-friendly gun store.” The source added that the two rifles used in the attack were purchased at a second store by a person they believed to be Farook’s former roommate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman reached by phone at Annie’s Get Your Gun, who identified herself as Anne, the store owner, denied that the weapons involved in the shooting were sold at her store.\n\n“That’s not true,” she said, before hanging up.\n\nRelatives of the victims on Thursday were still reeling from the shootings.\n\nJulie Swann-Paez, an inspector with the Health Department, was supposed to receive an employee of the year award at the party, according to relatives. But she was shot twice when Farook and Malik stormed the conference room. She suffered a shattered pelvis and other serious injuries.\n\n“Love you guys,” she said in a group text message to her family. “Was shot.”\n\nHer son, 26-year-old Nick Paez, didn’t see the message until at least an hour after the shooting, and raced to the hospital unsure of his mother’s condition.\n\n“I thought she was dead,” he said as he sat in his parents’ home with his younger brother and sister on Thursday. Photos of the family filled the small room.\n\nSwann-Paez’s loved ones weren’t allowed to visit her until 10 p.m. Nick Paez said he told his mother that her co-worker, Farook, may have been the shooter.\n\n“That doesn’t make sense,” Swann-Paez said, according to her son. “They were congratulating him for having a baby.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor others, the torturous wait for information ended in sorrow. Ryan Reyes said he dropped off his boyfriend, Kaufman, who went by his middle name, Daniel, at 7 a.m. at the regional center, where he managed the coffee shop.\n\nThey traded cheerful texts throughout the morning. But at 10:37 a.m., Reyes received an ominous message from his sister.\n\n“Hey Ry does Daniel work at the Regional Center in Sb?” the message read. “Check the news.”\n\nReyes, 32, called his boyfriend repeatedly but kept getting sent to voicemail.\n\n“Call me ASAP!” he texted.

         "In the last 24 hours, four federal courts have objected to Trump’s actions",
         "Last night, a Federal District court issued an emergency stay on deportations for passengers affected by President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. Since that first decision, three other courts have issued their own rulings, putting a halt to deportations for those detained at airports across the country.\n\nDespite the rulings, there appears to be some uncertainty surrounding the judicial orders. The New York Post reports that some customs agents have ignored the orders, and have not allowed access to detainees. We’ll update this report as more information becomes available.\n\nTrump’s team now appears to be tweaking the executive order in response to widespread protests. Late on Sunday night, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a waiver that allows people holding green cards or with valid permanent residence in the United States to enter the country. In a statement published on the DHS’ site, Kelly said that “in applying the provisions of the president’s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.” The statement says that “absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”\n\nHere’s where we stand:\n\nNew York City\n\nFederal Judge Ann Donnelly noted in her decision that that “there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject,” impacted by the order. The order was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a pair of Iraqi refugees who had been detained.\n\nThe order only applies to individuals who had been detained at airports around the country: that is, people who had come from one of the nations that were banned in the executive order.\n\nThe decision has no impact on the rest of the order, which bans citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya from entering the United States for the next 90 days, bans refugees from those countries for 120 days, and bans refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nAlexandria, Virginia\n\nFederal Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a ruling last night as well for 50 to 60 individuals from the affected countries who are Lawful Permanent Residents. According to petitioners, the people detained were denied access to lawyers, and that removing them from the country would result in “irreparable harm.”\n\nBrinkema agreed, ordering that the detained individuals be granted access to legal counsel, and forbid them from being deported for the next seven days.\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nIn Seattle, members of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed for an Emergency Stay of Removal on behalf of two individuals, saying that the detentions were illegal. District Court Judge Thomas Thomas S. Zilly ordered the stay of removal, “pending further order of the court.” He also set a hearing for Friday, February 3rd to determine whether or not to lift the stay.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nFinally, petitioners filed a petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive relief with the federal court overnight in Boston, Massachusetts. US District Judge Allison D. Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Gail Dein found that the detention and removal of “the petitioners and others similarly situated would violate their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection as guaranteed by the United States Constitution,” and that should the detained individuals be removed from the US, they would likely “suffer irreparable harm.”\n\nThe judges ordered that the Department of Homeland Security would be required to limit “secondary screening to comply with the regulations and statutes in effect prior to the Executive Order,” were not permitted to “detain or remove” approved refugees, anyone who held a valid Visa, green card holders, and other individuals “who, absent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.” The ruling stipulated that the United States Marshall of Massachusetts would be served with the order and required to enforce it, and that Border Patrol and Customs should notify airlines arriving at Boston’s Logan Airport of the order and that individuals on the flights would not be detained or deported. The judges noted that this ruling would remain in effect for seven days, with another hearing scheduled before then.\n\nThe four rulings represent a setback for the Trump administration, which was acting on campaign promises to halt the flow of refugees and immigrants to the United States, and were accompanied by widespread protests last night, with more planned in the coming days.\n\nFollowing the rulings, the American Civil Liberties Union has promised to continue to fight against the executive orders. “This is merely the first skirmish in a long battle to vigorously defend the Bill of Rights from the authoritarian designs of the Trump administration.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement this morning that it would “comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump’s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.”\n\nThis morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that the country needed extreme vetting, and pointed to immigration in Europe. He also defended his administration decision to provide preferential treatment to minority Christians attempting to enter the United States, noting that they were “executed in large numbers.”\n\nThis morning, The New York Times reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said that green card holders will be permitted to enter the country, but that they would have “discretionary authority” to detain and question individuals.\n\nUpdated to add information from The New York Times and details of John Kelly’s statement.\n\nTrump’s ‘Muslim ban’ won’t help security",

         "Health officials find first cases of new superbug in US",
         "Just five months after federal health officials asked hospitals and physicians to be on the lookout for an often-fatal, antibiotic-resistant fungus called Candida auris, 13 cases have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. It is the first time that the fungus, which is easily misidentified in lab tests as a more common candida yeast infection, has been found in the US, and four of the first seven patients with it have died.\n\n“We need to act now to better understand, contain and stop the spread of this drug-resistant fungus,” the CDC’s director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said in a statement. “This is an emerging threat, and we need to protect vulnerable patients and others.”\n\nC. auris’s emergence and apparent global spread — it was first identified in Japan in 2009 and since then has been found in a dozen countries on four continents — put the pathogen on the ever-growing list of superbugs, disease-causing microbes that are resistant to many and, in some cases, all antibiotics.\n\nRead more: Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nMore From Stat News Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nThe first seven cases, which are described in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, occurred in New York, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey in 2013 (one case), 2015 (one case), and this year (five cases). The older cases were identified through a review of patients’ lab records conducted after the CDC sent its clinical alert in June. All seven of the patients had been hospitalized for cancer, respiratory failure, or other serious condition, so it is not clear if C. auris contributed to the deaths of four of them, the CDC said.\n\nThe other six cases came to the CDC’s attention after August.\n\nFive of the first seven cases had not been flagged as C. auris at the time the patients were hospitalized, underlining the difficulty of identifying the fungus. Five were also resistant to the common antifungal drug fluconazole (sold as Diflucan). One was resistant to amphotericin B, an antifungal usually saved for serious infections, and one to echinocandins, a newer class of antifungals touted as being effective against Candida.\n\nAlthough C. auris strains from other countries have been found to be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs, none of the US cases was.\n\nThe global spread of C. auris has had public health officials on alert for imported cases, but all of the US cases seem to have been contracted domestically. When scientists sequenced the genomes of C. auris in the first seven cases, they found that they were related to strains from South Asia and South America. Since none of the patients had traveled to those areas or were known to have been in contact with anyone from there, CDC scientists concluded that they had acquired the infections locally.\n\n“It appears that C. auris arrived in the United States only in the past few years,” Dr. Tom Chiller, who leads CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch, said in a statement. “We’re working hard with partners to better understand this fungus and how it spreads.”\n\nA partial answer: easily. After one of the Illinois patients was hospitalized for an unrelated illness, researchers found C. auris in his mattress, bedside table, bed rail, chair, and windowsill.\n\nMore evidence of how easy C. auris is spread, at least in hospitals: The genome sequencing showed that the two patients treated in the same New Jersey hospital at the same time had nearly identical strains; the genome sequences of the C. auris infecting the two Illinois patients, also treated at the same hospital at the same time, were also nearly identical to one another. “These findings suggest that C. auris could be spread in healthcare settings,” the CDC said.\n\nAlthough 60 percent of people with C. auris infections outside the US have died, the CDC said, that figure is based on a small number of patients, many of whom had other severe illnesses, making it unclear how serious the infection on its own might be.",

Now THIS is how you secure a W for the right side of history!\n\nAs soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls. Yep, this teacher is the kind of heroic lover of freedom who simply refuses to have an affair with any student of hers who supports Trump’s despicable administration.\n\nHow’s that burn feel, Drumpf lovers??\n\nSo. Epic. It’s not always easy to take a stand in a world where bigotry of all kinds has become the norm since Treasonous Trump took the reins, so it’s absolutely thrilling when someone like Amanda Higgins claps back by telling her Trump-supporting student that she’ll no longer be having sex with him in her car after he’s done with wrestling practice. That 15-year-old MAGA shithead just found out the hard way that actions have consequences.\n\nMs. Higgins, we salute you! The Resistance believes that you deserve to be having sex with a student who believes in freedom and equality for all—not a hateful and bigoted Trump supporter like Eric. Let this be a warning shot to all you Dump lovers out there: If you support this corrupt administration, your days are as numbered as the president’s, because there are plenty more badass takedowns like this on the horizon!",

         "PBS and WETA Announce Groundbreaking Documentary Series ASIAN AMERICANS",
         "To Premiere May 2020 on PBS stations\n\nThe most ambitious television chronicle of the Asian American story\n\nin the United States will launch during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month\n\nBeverly Hills, CA; July 29, 2019 – Today at the Television Critics Association Press Tour, PBS and WETA announced ASIAN AMERICANS, a new five-part documentary series currently in production and expected to broadcast in May 2020 on PBS. The series examines what the 2010 U.S. Census identifies as the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States. Told through individual lives and personal histories, ASIAN AMERICANS explores the impact of this group on the country’s past, present, and future.\n\nLed by a team of Asian American filmmakers, including Academy Award®-nominated series producer Renee Tajima-Peña (Who Killed Vincent Chin?, No Más Bebés), ASIAN AMERICANS examines the significant role of Asian Americans in shaping American history and identity, from the first wave of Asian immigrants in the 1850s and identity politics during the social and cultural turmoil of the twentieth century to modern refugee crises in a globally connected world.\n\n“As America’s home for documentaries, PBS is committed to telling stories that illuminate and celebrate the rich diversity of our country,” said Paula Kerger, PBS President and CEO. “We are proud to share this important series with our audiences, and to deepen understanding about the extraordinary impact of Asian Americans on our national identity.”\n\n“ASIAN AMERICANS is a comprehensive multiplatform initiative that will embrace the question of what it means to be an American,” said Sharon Percy Rockefeller, President and CEO of WETA. “Following our previous series, The Jewish Americans, The Italian Americans and Latino Americans, WETA remains committed to revealing the significant stories of the entire American people.”\n\n“We are proud to support the Center for Asian American Media for the important work they do bringing programs about the Asian American experience to public media and audiences across the country,” said Pat Harrison, CPB president and CEO. “CPB is committed to supporting diverse content for and about people of all backgrounds, and ASIAN AMERICANS is a powerful example of our mission.”\n\n“We are proud to have WETA as a partner on this milestone series, which weaves the histories of many Asian American communities within the broad sweep of American history,” said Stephen Gong, Executive Director of the Center for Asian American Media. “These are American stories: stories of resilience in the face of racism, of overcoming challenges as refugees from war and strife, of making contributions in all sectors of society: business, technology, military service, and the arts. These Asian American experiences and voices provide a vital foundation for a future fast approaching, in which no single ethnic or racial group defines America, in which shared principles will define who we are as Americans.”\n\nAccompanied by robust educational, engagement, and digital components, this groundbreaking initiative will bring a new perspective to the American experience. Partnering with Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles, the series will aim to expand audience reach and engage diverse perspectives through targeted community events, impactful education initiatives and integrated digital content.\n\nASIAN AMERICANS is a production of WETA Washington, DC and the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM) for PBS, in association with the Independent Television Service (ITVS), Flash Cuts and Tajima-Peña Productions. The series executive producers are Jeff Bieber and Dalton Delan for WETA; Stephen Gong and Donald Young for CAAM; Sally Jo Fifer for ITVS; and Jean Tsien. The series producer is Renee Tajima-Peña.

         "NEW YORK—In a move touted as a major victory for the rights of New Yorker public transportation passengers who are this close to fucking losing it, the Metropolitan Transit Authority unveiled a new designated seating system Friday designed to accommodate commuters who seem to be just about to snap. “For too many years, the New York City MTA has failed to meet the needs of scowling riders repeatedly muttering ‘Fuck this shit’ under their breath, but today, we’re excited to announce that individuals about to blow a fuse will now be offered seats where they can have a second of goddamn peace,” said spokesman Aaron Donovan, adding that the initiative would cater to the roughly 1.7 million city residents who find themselves on the brink of daily violent meltdowns by adding a minimum of four seating options by the entrance of each subway car, rail car, and bus. “Those seats reserved for customers one bad moment away from flipping their wig at any second will have signage indicating them as such. Those who are clearly going through some serious shit and wearing an expression conveying ‘Not today’ have long been overlooked, so, as always, offer your seat to the critically cranked-up when at all possible.” Shortly after their introduction, thousands of transit passengers across New York City were seen going totally fucking apeshit upon discovering the priority seats already occupied.",

         "One Video Game Company Has Murky Ties To Trump’s Lawyer And Russian Payments",
         "Photo: Alexey Filippov (Host Photo Agency via Getty Images)\n\nRobert Mueller’s investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken all sorts of strange turns over the past year and a half, but this might be one of the strangest: It turns out that Trump’s lawyer has a circuitous connection to the video game company behind games like H1Z1 and Everquest.\n\n\n\nLast night, word came out that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, had received $500,000 in payments from a U.S. investment firm connected to a Russian oligarch named Viktor Vekselberg. That firm, Columbus Nova, has its fingers in a lot of pots. In January 2016, months before a wrestler’s lawsuit led to Kotaku’s former parent company Gawker Media getting purchased by Univision, Columbus Nova put a minority investment into Gawker. And in 2015, it was reported that Columbus Nova purchased Sony Online Entertainment, the San Diego, CA-based studio behind dozens of well-received video games. We knew that because both companies announced it together, with a press release declaring, “Columbus Nova acquires Sony Online Entertainment.” Alongside the move, the company said it would be changing its name to Daybreak.\n\n\n\nNow, Daybreak is rewriting history. Over the past few weeks, as the studio laid off staff amidst a declining audience for H1Z1, Daybreak has distanced itself from Columbus Nova, deleting said press release from its website and telling reporters that it had not actually been purchased by the investment firm, but in fact by businessman Jason Epstein. “Daybreak Game Company has no affiliation with Columbus Nova,” the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement on April 25. “Jason Epstein purchased Daybreak (then SOE) from Sony in February 2015. Mr. Epstein was a senior partner at Columbus Nova at the time he acquired the company. He left Columbus Nova in 2017 and remains the primary shareholder of Daybreak.”\n\nThat statement contradicts much of the company’s past three years, however. Daybreak described Columbus Nova as its parent company in its 2015 user privacy policy, as well as in a press release by Fenwick and West, the law firm that represented SOE in the acquisition. A spokesperson for Daybreak Games would not comment on how the press release could have been so misleading and why no subsequent statements that Columbus Nova owned the company were never corrected before now. Instead, Daybreak elaborated on its initial statement in a forum post, saying it was well aware of past statements made about the company’s ownership but that Epstein had been the majority owner since the acquisition. Daybreak’s spokespeople added that recent changes to the company’s website and third-party communications were simply part of a new effort to set the record straight.\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Daybreakgames.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuestions over Daybreak’s relationship to Columbus Nova began to bubble up in April, when the website MassivelyOP pointed out that the U.S. government had frozen some of Viktor Vekselberg’s assets, which it believed raised questions about the future of games like Everquest II. Vekselberg, a Russian businessman whose net worth in 2015 was reportedly $13.5 billion, is the owner of a company called Renova Group. Until this week, it was widely reported and believed that Columbus Nova was a subsidiary of Renova Group—something that Columbus Nova now denies. Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, has been the CEO of Columbus Nova since 2000 according to his bio on the investment firm’s website, a page which was removed sometime in the last 24 hours. And yesterday, Columbus Nova put out a statement denying that it was owned by Renova Group. “Throughout its existence, Columbus Nova has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients,” the statement reads. “Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group.”\n\n\n\nBoth Vekselberg and Intrater have donated to Trump and both attended his inauguration, according to The New York Times, which also reports that both men have since been interviewed by special prosecutor Bob Mueller’s office, the team in charge of investigating Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nSo here we are. Until April, everyone had believed that Columbus Nova owned Daybreak, which Daybreak now denies. Until this week, everyone had believed that Renova Group owned Columbus Nova—SEC filings even showed as much—which Columbus Nova now denies. And yesterday, news broke that Trump’s lawyer had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late April, as Daybreak was telling press that it was not actually owned by Columbus Nova, the game studio was also laying off staff. Laura Naviaux Sturr, chief publishing officer at Daybreak following the acquisition, left the company on April 25. A day later, many designers and programmers at Daybreak announced on Twitter that they had been let go.\n\nOne of the people laid off, an employee who had been at the company for over six years and asked not to be named, told Kotaku in an email that rumors of the layoffs had been circulating around the office for months and that some people had already cleared out their desks ahead of the official announcement. The employee, who was in a management role, said Epstein owning the company came as a surprise. “Most of us were just as confused by the statement as everyone else was,” they said. “I guess a select few people knew we weren’t actually owned by Columbus Nova, but they were definitely in the minority.”\n\nScreenshot: Daybreak Games (H1Z1)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former creative lead on Planetside 2, who also wished to remain anonymous, shared a similar story. “My understanding at the time was that we were being added to a holding company for Russian investments in tech which was run by Jason,” they told Kotaku. “There was an all-hands meeting shortly before I left where Jason introduced himself, explained who Columbus Nova and Renova were.” While their understanding was that Jason ran Columbus Nova, but was not acquiring the studio himself, they say the distinction was never really made explicit one way or the other.\n\n\n\nThat person left the company shortly after it was sold and after a large round of layoffs. Months later, studio president John Smedley, who had founded the company, left as well. (In the original press release about the sale, Smedley was attributed to the quote: “We are excited to join Columbus Nova’s impressive roster of companies.” Smedley did not respond to a request for comment.) He was replaced by Ji Ham, a vice president at Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAnd what of Columbus Nova’s ties to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and his company, Renova? Despite Columbus Nova’s denials, the web is full of bread crumbs linking the two companies. For example, while Jason Epstein’s profile on the Columbus Nova MB website no longer exists, an archived version of what appeared in September of 2016 lists him as a managing partner of Renova US Management, the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur own connections to Columbus Nova are also tied to Renova. For a period of time between January of 2016 and when Univision bought Gawker the following August, Jason Epstein was given a seat on Gawker’s board of directors. “My understanding at the time of the Columbus Nova investment in Gawker Media in January 2016 was that Columbus Nova was ultimately controlled by Viktor Vekselberg,” John Cook, who was then executive editor of Gawker Media, told me today. Columbus Nova was commonly understood to be the U.S. operating arm of the Russian conglomerate and ultimately owned by Vekselberg, something reiterated in multiple news reports at the time. At the same time, Cook said neither Vekselberg nor anyone at Columbus Nova attempted to exercise any influence over editorial matters during that time.\n\n\n\nMorale at Daybreak remains low, according to the source who was laid off from the studio two weeks ago. They told me that, based on conversations with people still at Daybreak, the atmosphere is grim, despite ongoing company-wide meetings to try and allay people’s concerns about the future of the company. As Daybreak prepares for the PS4 release of H1Z1, whose open beta will launch on May 22, its murky ties to Trump and the Russian investigation cannot be of much comfort.\n\n\n\nUpdate - 5:57pm: Updated the language in the second paragraph to clarify that while Columbus Nova’s acquisition of Daybreak was noted in a press release, it was otherwise not confirmed.",

         "Former stripper who filmed lovers seeks pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens",
         "CLAYTON • A former law student and male stripper prosecuted for invasion of privacy for secretly filming sex partners two decades ago is now seeking a pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, indicted under the same criminal statute last week.\n\nA letter sent Sunday to a lawyer for Greitens cites Greitens’ own motion to dismiss his case and his “published position on this statute,” and requests that the lawyer forward the request.\n\nThe pardon application was submitted to former Gov. Jay Nixon in 2011. He did not grant it or reject it, leaving it pending, the letter says.\n\nThe pardon request, sent by lawyer Albert Watkins, is on behalf of Paul Henreid, of Walnut Creek, Calif., who is a documentary filmmaker and lawyer.\n\nWatkins, who has never shied from publicity or controversy, said in a news release that it would be “mighty hypocritical” for Greitens to reject the request given Greitens’ dismissal motion.\n\n“What’s good for the governor should be good for the gander,” Watkins said.\n\nWatkins also represents the ex-husband of the woman with whom Greitens had an affair. Thursday’s indictment claims Greitens photographed her nude or partially nude without her consent and then transmitted that photograph in some unspecified way.\n\nThe governor’s motion to dismiss does not challenge the existence of a photo, but says the woman had no expectation of privacy, which is a requirement of the invasion of privacy statute, during a consensual sexual encounter.\n\nAudio: Woman describes encounter with Greitens A man says he recorded his then-wife describing an encounter with Eric Greitens in March 2015. The recording, obtained by the Post-Dispatch, w…\n\nIn a taped conversation with her husband, the woman said the governor took the photo without her consent during a consensual sexual encounter, then threatened to release it if she mentioned his name. Greitens has denied blackmailing the woman.\n\nThe scandal has prompted calls for Greitens’ resignation, as well as an independent investigation by legislators.\n\nHis lawyers lashed out at the indictment, and Greitens, a Republican, called it a “misguided political decision” by a “reckless liberal prosecutor” in a statement.\n\nLovers secretly filmed\n\nHenreid, then Paul Henroid, pleaded guilty to invasion of privacy in 1999 after he was caught filming multiple lovers without their knowledge.\n\nOne was a co-worker at the Metro East nightclub where Henroid “moonlighted as an exotic dancer,” the pardon application says. The filming was outed in 1997 by Henroid’s friend, who was also a rival for the woman’s affections, the application says.\n\nHenroid was indicted in 1998 on four counts: invasion of privacy, promoting child pornography, possession of child porn and child abuse. The child porn and abuse charges came because she was 17 at the time of the filming. Although she could legally consent to sex, it was illegal to film her fully or partially nude, the pardon application says.\n\nHenroid’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the invasion of privacy statute as unconstitutionally vague and, foreshadowing Greitens’ own challenge 20 years later, as aimed at “peeping Toms,” not someone engaged in consensual sex, the application says. Henroid then pleaded guilty to the invasion of privacy charge as part of a deal that resulted in the dismissal of the other charges.\n\nHe expected a type of probation that would erase the conviction from the public record, but the judge disagreed. She sentenced him to 30 days of shock time and left him with a conviction, saying he shouldn’t be allowed to be a lawyer “because you have shown no regard for that law or the rights of others,” according to a transcript of the hearing. He was ordered to spend the 30 nights in jail but was allowed out during the day to work.\n\nHenreid is considering running for public office, the application says. He admits that his actions were “deceitful and immoral,” but says the punishment he has suffered and continues to suffer “is unwarranted based on the facts of this case.”\n\nGreitens’ lawyers couldn’t be immediately reached for comment Sunday.",

         "‘When I’m Onstage Performing, There Can Be Up To A Dozen Confused Birds Flapping Around The Ceiling And I Hardly Notice Them At All’: 5 Questions With Janelle Monáe\n\nJanelle Monáe first made her mark in the music world in 2010 with her critically acclaimed debut album, The ArchAndroid, and her incredible artistry and vision have garnered six Grammy nominations since. Monáe has also brought her powerful storytelling abilities to the big screen with roles in two beloved recent films: Hidden Figures and Moonlight. We sat down with the entertainer to talk about her work as an actress, her political activism, and how she produced her most recent studio album.\n\n1. You were signed to Bad Boy Records for the bulk of your career until leaving in 2015. What was your experience with the Diddy-run label like?\n\nIt was definitely a little frustrating. Back when I signed in 2007, it felt like the label was still searching for the artist who would fill The Notorious B.I.G.’s shoes, and at times it seemed like they were hoping it’d be me. Diddy was always interrupting my recording sessions to say things like, “Please, please be mean to Tupac in the next part of this song,” or, “I’m begging you to call Tupac a bald little bitch during the chorus this time. We really need this.” It started to get in the way of my creative process when Diddy would pull me aside and say, “The way Tupac wore his bandana kind of looks like a big Christmas bow—maybe you could do something with that.” Eventually, I got tired of being at a label that couldn’t grow beyond the Biggie vs. Tupac days, so I had to leave.\n\n2. You enlisted the help of The Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson on your new album, Dirty Computer. Was it hard to get him on board?\n\nIt was difficult at first because he didn’t really seem to get what I was going for musically, but once I began breaking things down in a way that was more in his wheelhouse, he was incredible. The breakthrough happened when I came up with a few simple analogies and instructions that he could understand, like “Imagine the microphone is a surfboard and I’m the blonde babe who’s surfing on it in one of those old-ass striped one-piece bathing suits,” or, “I want the production of this song to sound nothing like what you imagine seaweed to sound like underwater,” or, “Sing these lyrics, but mention being buried in sand as little as possible while you do it.” Those analogies did wonders in getting us on the same page. The guy is a legend, and I was happy we could find a way to work together.\n\n3. For you, what’s the main difference between performing as a singer and performing as an actor?\n\nWhen I’m acting, if two birds somehow find their way indoors and fly right in front of the camera it can be enough to completely ruin an entire take. But when I’m performing to a capacity crowd in a huge music venue, there can be up to a dozen confused birds flapping around the ceiling and I hardly notice them at all.\n\n4. You’ve been known to wear tuxedos both onstage and off. How did you develop that personal uniform?\n\nI think tuxedos are the ideal clothing item because they’re so versatile. In a full tuxedo, you’re equally at home at a fancy gala or a drunken beach party, a black-tie wedding or a backyard mud-wrestling tournament, a champagne cruise or a race through the woods to find the EpiPen that a squirrel stole from your cousin. I feel like I can go anywhere in a tuxedo, and that’s why I love wearing one.\n\n5. You’ve been an outspoken political activist in recent years, leading Black Lives Matter marches and working to secure aid for people affected by the Flint, Michigan water crisis. What drives you to be politically engaged?\n\nIt’s simple. I know that if I don’t do something about the problems in our society, someone else will have to—and I’m worried that it would end up being someone weird, like that guy from the Guinness Book Of World Records with the beard of bees. I don’t want to see the bees guy become an activist, so I step up.",

         "1.4 million college kids will drink alcohol today",
         "On any given day in America, roughly 1.4 million college students between the ages of 18 and 22 — or more than 1 out of every 8 American undergrads — will drink alcohol, according to new data from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Those who partake will consume an average of about four drinks each — just below the five-drink threshold that defines binge drinking. Of course, many of them will drink more than that. Many will drink less.\n\nOther young people will opt to alter their consciousness with different substances. Roughly 900,000 college students, or 1 in 12, will get stoned. About 15,000 will do cocaine, 13,000 will do hallucinogens of some kind (magic mushrooms, LSD), and more than 7,200 will do heroin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very next day, the exact same scenario will play out again. Some of those who drink and do drugs tomorrow will be the same ones who drank and did drugs today. Others will take a break from the partying, perhaps waiting a day, a week or a month before doing it again.\n\nIt all adds up to paint a vivid picture of the prevalence of substance use among college kids in America today. This isn't necessarily a problem — statistically speaking, most of this drinking and drug-taking is normal behavior. Most college drinkers and drug users graduate on to their next phase of life without suffering any adverse consequences from all those nights at the bar.\n\nBut if it's normal behavior, it also isn't without risk. On-campus drinking and drug use is associated with higher dropout rates. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, each year college-age drinking directly leads to:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1,825 deaths\n\n690,000 assaults\n\n97,000 sexual assaults\n\n599,000 other injuries\n\n150,000 alcohol-related health problems\n\nCollege students aren't alone when it comes to a propensity to overdo it. People between the ages of 18 and 25 are generally the heaviest users of substances legal and illegal, regardless of whether they're in college. But the overall trends in drug and alcohol use among this group are generally moving in a positive direction.\n\nSince 2002, for instance, America's 18-to-25-year-olds have become less likely to use illicit drugs other than marijuana. They've become significantly less likely to use tobacco. And while their overall use of alcohol is about the same, their rates of problematic drinking — bingeing and heavy alcohol use — are down sharply, especially among young men.\n\nSo while the top-line numbers of millions of college drinkers may seem alarming, consider the flip side of the coin as well: If 1 out of every 8 college kids is drinking on any given night, that means the other seven kids are doing something else — like going to the library, playing games or just hanging out with friends.\n\nAdvertisement",

         "Get The Tissues Ready: The Next Song On This Emo Album Is Just A Guy’s First Name So You Know It’s Going To Be About The Lead Singer’s Friend Who Died When They Were In High School\n\nIf you’re not in the mood for a good cry, you’re gonna want to stop here, because the waterworks are about to be turned all the way up: The next song on this emo album is just a guy’s first name, so you know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s friend who died when they were in high school.\n\nYup, it’s pretty clear. There’s basically only one way this next song could go, and it’s going to be an absolute downer.\n\nEverything’s pretty much been par for the course as the second song on this emo album winds down. The first two songs were titled “I Feel January In My Bones” and “These Hands For The Trembling,” and covered standard emo fare like the vague sadness of realizing that the people you once looked up to don’t have all the answers and how all of the lead singer’s high school friends used to have big dreams but ended up getting stuck in their hometown. But things are definitely about to get much more bleak because the third track on the album is just called “Mikey,” so you just fucking know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s best friend from high school who couldn’t overcome his debilitating opioid addiction and overdosed or died in a car accident or some depressing shit like that.\n\nWhile it was easy to tell that this album was going to be at least a little sad by the looks of the cover art, which just shows an upperish-middle-class suburban house in the wintertime and has the band’s name stamped in a simple cursive font on the bottom right corner, it’s pretty clear that once “Mikey” starts, the vibe of the album is about to go from general angsty-sad to full-blown-crying sad.\n\nSeriously, you should definitely turn the album off before it gets to “Mikey” unless you want to listen to the lead singer blame himself for his friend’s early death with lines like, “I should’ve been there when you needed me most//and now I waltz with the cold of your ghost,” or, “Your eyes were too hazy to see the tears in mine//and now yours are shut forever.” Point blank, this is going to be a massive bummer.\n\nFinal warning, because the current song is wrapping up now, so if you don’t bail now, you’re about to get emotionally wrecked by “Mikey.” It’s almost definitely going to start off quietly and slowly build up until the lead singer is full-blown screaming metaphors that describe his friend as a short but intense mid-summer storm casting brief shadows across forgotten power lines, and it’s probably going to leave you feeling melancholy for the rest of the day. But if you have your tissues handy and are ready to hear the lead singer and the drummer sing intertwining vocals about how the friend’s funeral scarred the lead singer so badly that he can’t even walk past the church it was held in anymore or something along those lines, then strap the fuck in and let the tears roll. Good luck!",

In every situation, it was important that the firefighters maintain their own safety.\n\nThis team had no idea what type of animal they were about to save, so they had to be cautious.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to hear the rescue unfold!\n\nExperience\n\nLuckily, the firefighters weren’t too worried about this particular job. In fact, the team had lots of experience.\n\nEven though they weren’t sure what kind of animal was in trouble, it was safe to say that they would be able to handle it.\n\nThis time things would be different! Click ‘Next’!\n\nAssessing the Situation\n\nThey got into their truck and raced to the location where the distressed animals appeared to be.\n\nThe animals were trapped deep beneath a storm grate. If the weather changed and it filled with water, the animals would be in trouble.\n\nWhat was waiting inside? You’ll never guess!\n\nTick Tock\n\nWithout rainy weather, the animals were fairly safe in the enclosure.\n\nThe firefighters knew that time was of the essence. Not only was the enclosure dark and deep, but it was also cold! There was no time to waste.\n\nWhat was the game plan? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Plan\n\nThe firefighters came to the conclusion that the creatures were likely fairly small. The sewer grate wasn’t very deep, and yet the animals still couldn’t get out.\n\nOnly one or two men would be needed to pull the animals out. Everyone prepped themselves.\n\nYou won’t guess what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Glance\n\nThe firefighters worked together to raise the storm grate away and expose the area beneath. They could hear the small cries of animals below.\n\nThey were quick to realize that this little group of creatures were babies. What were they doing there?\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Unfit Home\n\nThis was a very odd place for small animals to be. Animals are much better off being in the wild.\n\nThese animals were far away from any wild habitat, and weren’t going to get what they needed in this sewer grate.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbandoned Babies?\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t be sure what kind of animals were trapped in the storm drain. They took time to canvas the area.\n\nIt was likely that if there was a mom or dad around, the firefighters would have spooked them away.\n\nWhat would the firefighters do? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bad Situation\n\nWhen they saw the babies, they couldn’t believe that they were still alive. The sewer was filled with dirt and garbage.\n\nThe animals must have been freezing cold, and there was clearly no food in sight to be eaten.\n\nWould the poor babies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitive Situation\n\nThe firefighters had to approach carefully. If the mother was nearby, then perhaps she would be the one to save them.\n\nBut, if the firefighters did handle the babies, the mother may return later and decide to abandon them.\n\nTime was running out. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nTense Moments\n\nThe team of rescuers weren’t sure what kind of animals these were, which made it hard to know if the mother might be around.\n\nThere was no way of knowing what was best, but it looked like these critters needed assistance.\n\nWhat would they do!? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Decision\n\nThe firefighters had a decision to make. Should they leave the babies there, or wait for the mother to return?\n\nThey knew the babies couldn’t get out themselves. It was time to find out what animal they were dealing with.\n\nWe can’t make this up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating\n\nThe firefighters would have to investigate, by pulling out the animals and identifying exactly what they were.\n\nIf they were domestic, it was likely that these animals needed some serious help. Other wild animals might not be so desperate.\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rescue Begins\n\nThe team made sure to wear gloves, so as to avoid getting their natural smell onto the babies.\n\nA sheet was laid out beside the sewer, so that they could easily place the animals down safely once they were rescued.\n\nWe can’t make this up! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First\n\nThe firefighter slowly reached down into the sewer and gently pulled up the first baby.\n\nAt first glance, the team was in shock at the small furry animal. It was actually very cute and rolled around on the sheet innocently.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what the firefighters found!\n\n\n\n\n\nMan’s Best Friend\n\nAfter getting a good look at the first baby, the team knew what they were dealing with: Puppies!\n\nThey had no idea how the animals had gotten there, but now they knew for sure that they shouldn’t be there.\n\nWhat happens next will shock you! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sad State\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe it. The team worried that the puppies were put there by someone.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn’t uncommon for pet owners to abandon their pets. Sometimes they assume the only option is to dispose of them when desperate.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nHard Truths\n\nThe team hoped that abandonment wasn’t the case in this situation. That would have been so heartbreaking for the poor puppies\n\nWith this potential circumstance in mind, the firefighters pressed on even faster to try and help the puppies.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out why the firefighters were so angry!\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Solution\n\nFor those pet owners who aren’t able to take care of their animals, the firefighters knew that this could be a good lesson for everyone.\n\nIt is never okay to abandon animals in unfit environments. The team hoped this wasn’t the true case.\n\nThe rescue was going forward! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Litter\n\nThere was no telling how many were inside the sewer grate at first, so the team had to wait until all of them were out.\n\nLuckily, the sewer wasn’t too deep, so it was easy for the firefighters to get them all.\n\nWhat would the team do next? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Huddle\n\nThe puppies were surely very confused. One moment they were in a sewer and the next, surrounded by humans.\n\nThe poor puppies huddled together for warmth. It was clear that they had been like this for a few days.\n\nWhat happened to these little guys? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering Clues\n\nThe team was still confused as to how this situation had even begun. They spoke first with the witness who reported it.\n\nShe explained that she spotted the puppies being swept along a fast-moving stream and into the storm drain.\n\nThis lady was a regular day hero. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sigh of Relief\n\nThe lady recalled what had happened. They were glad that they hadn’t been physically put into the sewer by someone.\n\nThis changed the situation drastically. Somehow the puppies had gotten too close to the storm drain and been swept inside.\n\nThe puppies mysterious story continued. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Moves\n\nWhen the lady saw the puppies being swept away, she tried to act quickly. She tried to catch up with the puppies in time, but it was too late.\n\nShe tried to open the grate, but she didn’t have the tools.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what she did!\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling in for Help\n\nWhen the woman realized that she couldn’t help the animals herself, she decided to make the call for help.\n\nLuckily, the firefighters knew what to do, and they had the tools that were needed. They were grateful that she had called.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out something amazing about the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Great Example\n\nThe firefighters were glad to hear the actual story of the puppies. One civilian had noticed something in danger and made sure that she took action.\n\nThey hoped that everyone would do the same if they ever encountered such a situation.\n\nThe firefighters investigate. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Guesses\n\nThe the firefighters started trying to guess what kind of breed they were. All of the puppies were black with short, wiry hair.\n\nThey decided that the puppies must be Labrador puppies. It seemed like this was the best guess.\n\nThe team was going to be in for a surprise. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that all of the puppies were safe, it was time to make sure that they were all healthy.\n\nWith that, the team took the puppies to a Humane Society, in order to make sure that the animals were okay.\n\nWould the puppies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Good Shape\n\nThe firefighters were happy to hear that all of the puppies were in relatively good health. None of them seemed to be malnourished, and they were very strong.\n\nWith that, the firefighters decided that their job was complete.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’ to see what happens to the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Call\n\nMark Jenkins was one of the firefighters who was a part of the rescue. After the pups were dropped off, he left his phone number for updates.\n\nHe didn’t expect to hear about them so soon, but he got a call right after.\n\nWere the puppies okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting News\n\nThe vet was quick to assure Mark that the animals were fine, and that they did a good deed of sending them over to the vet.\n\nIt was a surprising piece of information that almost made Mark laugh out loud.\n\nWhat was the amazing surprise? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Surprise\n\nWhat the vet had to tell Mark was that the puppies had a little surprise for him.\n\nIn fact, the puppies …weren’t even dogs at all! Mark couldn’t believe his ears. They weren’t even dogs? How was this possible?\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nShocking News\n\nThe vet explained that the animals were dogs at all, but actually foxes! And they were red foxes to be exact.\n\nThe vet explained that puppies and fox cubs do have some similarities at birth, particularly because red foxes often aren’t red.\n\nThis was shocking! Click ‘Next’ to find out how it all happened!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Deed\n\nMark shared the news with the rest of his team, and they couldn’t believe the news either. Everyone had been so sure that they were puppies.\n\nRegardless of the new developments, the team was happy that they could help. It was a good day!\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe what they had to do next! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing Back\n\nEven though the baby foxes had now been saved, their story was not even close to being over!\n\nThe vet explained that the mother might still be in the area. If they could put the babies back in time, she might find them.\n\nWould the plan work? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth a Shot\n\nThey felt like they were going back a bit, but the firefighters knew that taking the foxes back was the only way. Reluctantly, the small animals went back into their sewer drain.\n\nOf course, the babies were watched closely during this time.\n\nTime would tell if the mother would return. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience\n\nOnce all of the foxes were returned to their sewer, the team waited patiently. It was important that they keep a safe distance away.\n\nIt was possible that she wouldn’t return until night. It was a waiting game for everyone.\n\nYou won’t believe what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Practices\n\nThe red fox is a very cunning animal. Most red foxes stay inside their den during the day, and move about during the night.\n\nUnfortunately, there were no signs of the mother overnight; they hoped she’s return in the morning.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Show\n\nUnfortunately, after a lot of waiting, there was no sign of the mother fox. The babies could be heard inside the sewer calling for her.\n\nShe may have been spooked by all of the action that happened earlier in the day.\n\nWhat would they do now? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving In\n\nAfter a lot of waiting, everyone’s patience seemed to wear out. It was assumed that the mother wasn’t going to be coming back after a few nights.\n\nWith time, it was decided that it was time to intervene again. The baby foxes needed assistance.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out where the foxes ended up!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nWhen the decision was made, it was time to make moves. The animals were once again gathered from the sewer and brought to the Animal Clinic of Woodland Park.\n\nThe clinic was going to be a huge help for these foxes.\n\nYou don’t want to miss this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Lessons\n\nThe clinic offers help and rehabilitation to animals of all shapes and sizes.\n\nFor other animals, like the baby foxes, the team at the clinic help to raise the babies until they are old enough to take care of themselves in the wild.\n\nThe foxes were in good hands, but the story wasn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming Educated\n\nThe story of the foxes was a funny one, but it was also an educational one. The team of firefighters learned a lot about them during this rescue.\n\nThere is so much to know about wild animals and how to deal with them.\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Very Surprising\n\nFinding the baby foxes was a huge surprise for the firefighters, but it wasn’t a huge surprise to animal experts.\n\nIt was likely that the mother fox has mated just months earlier and had given birth to them.\n\nThis wasn’t the only thing that made sense. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Spot\n\nAnimal experts also weren’t surprised by the find, since the cubs were found in Colorado. This state is well-known for its fox population.\n\nColorado has all kinds of perfect terrain for foxes, including mountains, hills, and lots of perfect places for dens.\n\nThis part is shocking. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Acceptable Place\n\nIt seemed unheard of that the mother fox would put her babies in a sewer grate. However, animal experts also understood why she might have done this.\n\nIn their natural habitat, their dens are commonly dark, cool spaces.\n\nThis mother fox made a mistake. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nHonest Mistake\n\nThe mother fox who left these cubs behind may have made a bit of a mistake when she was picking her den.\n\nThe sewer was dark and cool, and had similar characteristics to a common den in the fox’s natural habitat.\n\nThis story gets even crazier. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Birth\n\nThe story of the fox cubs was slowly coming together. Although no one could guess how the babies got there at first.\n\nThe most likely answer, was that the mother fox had actually given birth to her babies inside the sewer!\n\nWould the foxes be okay? Click ‘Next’ to learn more!\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Outlook\n\nEven though the baby foxes had been abandoned, there was still a good chance that the baby foxes were going to be okay.\n\nTo make matters even better, the baby foxes had gone through serious rehabilitation at a young age.\n\nYou won’t believe this fact. Click ‘Next’ to hear it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Occurrence\n\nThe firefighters were surprised at finding baby foxes in the busy city, but it isn’t actually an uncommon occurrence.\n\nThis is often a result of growing cities, which are starting to take over the habitat that foxes would usually roam in.\n\nWhat if a fox chooses your home? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapting\n\nThe sad thing about foxes becoming comfortable in urban areas, is that they are often seen as pests and miscreants.\n\nIt gets harder and harder for animals to find homes as habitat loss continues. People don’t understand why the foxes are nearby.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out how you can help!\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for Help\n\nThe lady who came across them did the right thing, when she decided to call for help.\n\nIt’s much better to call the appropriate help, who can handle the animals safely and assess the situation properly. Many animals should simply be left alone!\n\nWhat do you need to know?! Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Not Always Bad\n\nWhen people find baby animals that are alone, they often assume that the baby is in trouble. However, this is not always the case.\n\nSome newborn animals, such as rabbits, are alone for almost 23 hours in a day!\n\nAll in a day’s work. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Happy Ending\n\nFor these baby foxes, their ending was a happy one. One caring lady and some firefighters were able to make sure that they were well taken care of.\n\nGoing forward, the cubs will be able to grow up in their natural habitat together.\n\nThe story isn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping A Look Out\n\nWith more and more suburban growth, animals will continue to struggle for their own, personal space.\n\nIf you do happen to come across an animal that seems out of place, it’s a great idea to contact local authorities for assistance.\n\nThat Was The Last One!

         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session",
         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session\n\nThe relationship between therapist and patient can be a complicated one, and sometimes, it’s hard to tell exactly what your therapist is thinking. Here are four signs that your therapist is planning on hightailing it to Six Flags Great America right after you finish your session.\n\n1. She keeps blaming your fear of intimacy on the fact that you didn’t ride enough roller coasters as a child: If your therapist is antsy to get to Six Flags and just phoning it in until then, chances are she’s probably already got roller coasters on the brain, and that might end up coming out in your session. Sure, it’s possible that your therapist is just using roller coasters as some sort of metaphor for the ups and downs of life, but if she keeps bringing up specific rides like the Fiddler’s Fling while you’re talking through your difficulty with letting people in, it’s likely because she can’t wait to leave you mid-sentence on the couch the second your time is up and head straight to the amusement park.\n\n2. She’s insisting that the best way for you to solve your conflict with your parents is to measure her to make sure she’s taller than 54 inches, the minimum height required to ride the Raging Bull: If your therapist whips out a measuring tape while you’re on the verge of a major breakthrough about your childhood and tells you the best way to heal is to double-check that she’s over 54 inches tall, it’s a pretty good sign that she’s planning on heading to Six Flags in the very near future. Fifty-four inches isn’t that tall, so it only makes sense someone who has immediate plans to ride the Raging Bull or any of Great America’s other height-restricted rides would be so concerned with passing what would otherwise seem like a relatively arbitrary height requirement. And if she’s willing to interrupt you in the middle of your session, it’s likely because she doesn’t have long before she’s hitting the road to Six Flags.\n\n3. You overhear her muttering, “I wish therapy had a Flash Pass,” to herself: If your therapist looks distractedly out the window and imagines a world where therapy had a device that allowed her to cut right to the end of your session, it’s pretty clear her head is already in Gurnee, IL, soaking in the sights and sounds of Great America. This might be the first time she’s splurged on the real Six Flags Flash Pass, so if she’s doing the “wrap it up” motion while you’re talking about how your parents got divorced on your eighth birthday, it’s because she’s daydreaming about running from Goliath to Viper without having to wait in long lines.\n\n4. She tells you you’re cured: On its face, this is great news, but don’t allow yourself to be too caught up in the moment before you take some time to assess the situation. Do you feel cured? If the answer is no, your therapist may just be trying to rush you out of the door so she can get on the road to Six Flags before traffic sets in. If your therapist announces that you’ve finally made peace with your demons and have reached the highest level of self-actualization while she’s hurriedly applying sunscreen to her forearms and shoving a Six Flags Flash Pass into her pocket, then chances are that you still may have some work to do, and your therapist is just going to Great America.",

         "SANTA FE, TX—In the hours following a violent rampage in Texas in which a lone attacker killed eight individuals and seriously injured several others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Friday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. “This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them,” said Ohio resident Erica Webb, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world’s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. “It’s a shame, but what can we do? There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”",

         "‘The Joker’ Reviewed By An Angry Mother Who Hasn’t Seen It Share:\n\nTHE HIGHLY controversial movie (according to online media) has been the source of fierce debate (according to online media) sparking calls for discussions on how movie violence encourages real life imitators (according to online media).\n\nThe Joker, released today in cinemas, illegal downloads, in the ‘synopsis’ section of Wikipedia pages and in carefully crafted online summaries designed to coax people into apoplectic rage fits is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nIn an effort to make no effort whatsoever to provide an actual expert on such matters with an important platform in a widely read publication that could see this push for faux controversy disproved and deflated we have instead asked Karen Carty (51), who is very mad at the violence and toxic messages contained in a movie she hasn’t seen, to review ‘The Joker’:\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen, a mother-of-three, began while tutting dismissively.\n\n“Suppose it’s not as bad over here when ya show violent sorts of movies, but Jesus Christ, people over in America are trying to go see this movie dressed as the Joker. It’s depraved stuff,” Karen added, alluding to some US cinemas operating a ban on people wearing Joker clothes, but allowing people to carry guns because America.\n\n“What ever happened to that hunk Cesar Romero who used to be Joker, how did the Joker come to this? I remember the worst violence in Batman was when they were climbing up the side of a building and being shouted at by apartment owners, now it’s bombs this, semi-automatic weapons that,” added Karen of the bygone era of the 1960s when murder had yet to be invented by violent video games.\n\n“I hear it’s awful violent, and it’s making kids mad for murder,” a shocked Karen explained, one hand covering her mouth to further illustrate her shock at coming to the conclusion that someone had made a movie that was so violently persuasive it could flip a switch in thousands of innocent minds and turn them into demented killers.\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen reiterated. “They shouldn’t be allowed make that sort of movie,” added Karen turning angry at the thought of a film news outlets told her would give her that warm angry feeling if she just clicked the link on their article.\n\n“Downton Abbey, now there’s a lovely movie. Why can’t people just make more of them?”",

         "Preparing for Irma? There’s an app for that\n\nFalse information being spread about @Zello and what it can do during and after storm. Here are the facts https://t.co/5p5TIEpwgG pic.twitter.com/EH8cCJrRAy — WPLG Local 10 News (@WPLGLocal10) September 6, 2017\n\nZello, an app that turns cellphones into walkie-talkies, connecting and broadcasting traffic like a police scanner, has become an emergency hub for nervous Floridians awaiting Hurricane Irma’s landfall Sunday.\n\nThe technology originated a decade ago, and was increasingly used during clashes in Egypt, Ukraine and Venezuela. Last week, it became the most popular free app for both Android and iPhone users after Hurricane Harvey struck Texas. Volunteers there used Zello channels such as Cajun Navy Dispatch to provide advice to flood victims and information to civilian rescuers.\n\nLate Saturday, one of the most popular channels, Hurricane Irma, had attracted more than a thousand users from across the world, primarily in Florida.\n\nCalls came from young mothers, teenage boys, power line workers, veterans and emergency responders. Some reported tornadoes, others rising water, exploding transformers and suspicious activity on web cams. Some worried about looting. They shared storm surge maps, apps to track tornadoes and monitor weather radar. Many asked about evacuating. A few joked. Most pleaded for help, worried that time was running out for them and their families.\n\nA glimpse of their fraught discussions, starting just after dark at 7 p.m. Eastern time (some users rely on nicknames, while others provide their real name and location):\n\nBarbaraw2 (New Middletown, Ohio): People in the Sarasota area evacuate now. You have exactly one hour. If you do not know where a shelter is, look up www.capecoralupdate shelter. There are shelters open now.\n\nCaraRogers (Palm Bay, Fla.): Guys to correct her, you have 45 minutes, not an hour. Barbara can you copy, 45 minutes?\n\nBarbaraw2: Copy Cara, I meant to say 45\n\nPusom (Nelson Gonzalez): Is there any way I can get wifi during the storm?\n\nCaraRogers: At this time guys, Wifi is the least of your worries\n\nAmeer Saleem 18: Xfinity has set up mobile hotspots throughout Florida.\n\nKdrkvz: (Dave, assistant emergency coordinator, Galloway, NJ) There was a woman asking about Spanish language info, can you let her talk?\n\nPacposhopez: (boy chuckling) Um, I got a question, what’s the name of the hurricane?\n\nLcjcus: Someone should be talking about the tornado warnings in Palm Beach and Miami Dade counties that were just issued\n\nRosa&Lex (Rosa, shelter worker, Las Vegas): Hey guys, I just want to let you know that I have a channel for the Spanish speaking community it’s ##irmaayudainformacionespanol\n\nCommsTech: There’s also sister site of ours that’s Hurricane Irma espanol.\n\nDylan_ball: People who haven’t evacuated already are frickin ignorant. This is ridiculous.\n\nRed Actual (Delray Beach, Fla.): You need to evacuate. The storm has shifted to western Florida. Storm surges are expected to rise to 12 feet. The governor has issued an evacuation. If you do not evacuate you will not get rescued until the storm passes.\n\nKearrah Hollis (Floral City, Fla.): If you are in need of rescue put a bright colored towel or sheet on top of your house.\n\nPJS203: Por favor hablo espanol, gracias.\n\nPierre G (Ontario, Canada): Multiple tornadoes have touched down in Broward County as we speak\n\nBenbruh (youth): There’s a tornado in Tampa. Please leave the area now\n\nBeaver (youth): I’m in Tampa, there’s no damn tornado.\n\nCaraRogers: Guys, we have to keep these channels clear! This is some people’s only way to get assistance, because 911 is not going to be dispatching fire and police. You will be silenced if you come in with something irrelevant. Keep the station clear.\n\nIamnisa1: Does anybody know when the hurricane is coming to Lehigh Acres, Ft Myers area? I have a one year old and I’m really worried. I’m not prepared.\n\nCaraRogers: To the mother of the one year old, you still have time to get to call 311 and get to shelter.\n\nSammy9225 (Samantha Allen, Port Richey, Fla.): Is it too soon to have a bag ready to go? I have two bags ready for me and my family and should I take my son’s car seat out of my car now or leave it in there?\n\nRubenthecuben1 Ruben Solis, Summerfield, Fla.): I live in a mobile home, do you have any idea what I should do? Board up my windows?\n\nCaraRogers: If you are in a mobile home you need to evacuate immediately and get to a shelter.\n\nRubenthecuben1: So should I not board up my windows or should I board up my windows on my mobile home?\n\nBarbaraw2: No, you should get out of your mobile home now!\n\n(people laugh) No seriously, you can board up your windows if you want, but I would not stay there in that mobile home. You really seriously need to evacuate and go to a safer place.\n\nBarbaraw2: Also if you evacuate, take a black sharpie and put the number of people that went with you so that keeps the rescuers from having to come up to check. It just keeps everything going.\n\nUomshouse: Don’t let people know you evacuated unless you want to get robbed.\n\nBarbaraw2: Your personal stuff is not important as much as your life is.\n\nSammy9925: (baby cries in background) I’m in Port Richey, Florida. When it hits and if our windows break and we go to the middle of our house, what do we do after that because we did not get enough wood to do all of our windows, unfortunately.\n\nCaraRogers: What you are going to do is go to a center area with no windows or if it gets to be as serious as it may you’re going to want to go into the bathroom and get your family into the bathtub and cover the bathtub with something that can shield you from falling debris.\n\nStormwatch3000: If you get in a bath tub for a tornado the best thing to put on top of you is a mattress.\n\nJoako537: I’m here in Tampa trying to find out where I can get a generator.\n\nCommsTech: Man, I think you’re a little late on that.",

         "Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex",
         "TOPEKA, KS—Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible.\n\nDuring a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation’s heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group’s long-standing mission and values.\n\n“Although we’ve traditionally dedicated 97 percent of our resources to other important services such as contraception distribution, cancer screening, and STD testing, this new complex allows us to devote our full attention to what has always been our true passion: abortion,” said Richards, standing under a banner emblazoned with Planned Parenthood’s new slogan, “No Life Is Sacred.” “And since Congress voted to retain our federal funding, it’s going to be that much easier for us to maximize the number of tiny, beating hearts we stop every day.”\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/a-look-inside-planned-parenthoods-8-billion-abortionpl-1819590293\n\n“The Abortionplex’s high-tech machinery is capable of terminating one pregnancy every three seconds,” Richards added. “That’s almost a million abortions every month. We’re so thrilled!”\n\nThe 900,000-square-foot facility has more than 2,000 rooms dedicated to the abortion procedure. The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives.\n\nThe remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater—features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event.\n\n“We really want abortion to become a regular part of women’s lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions,” said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. “Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus.”\n\n“All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex,” Richards continued. “Whether she’s a high school junior who doesn’t want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can’t be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control—all are welcome.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Marcy Kolrath, one of the Abortionplex’s first clients, told reporters that despite her initial hesitancy, she was quickly put at ease by staff members who reassured her that she could have abortions over and over for the next decade before finally committing to motherhood. Kolrath also said she was “wowed” by the facility’s many attractions.\n\n“I was kind of on the fence in the beginning,” she said. “But after a couple of margaritas and a ride down the lazy river they’ve got circling the place, I got caught up in the vibe. By the time it was over, I almost wished I could’ve aborted twins and gotten to stay a little longer.”\n\n“I told my boyfriend we had to have sex again that very night,” Kolrath added. “I really want to come back over Labor Day.”",

         "Why Would Regulators Ban Kratom, An Herb For Recovering Addicts?",
         "Image Credit Wikimedia\n\nOnce Andrew Turner learned of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s plan to ban the medicinal herb he uses to manage a host of medical issues, he did what many activists do: recorded his personal testimony and put it up on YouTube.\n\nThe Navy veteran didn’t just tell his story; he could actually show what life without Kratom was like for him. Turner suffers from combat-related disabilities, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, Meige syndrome, and dystonia. He takes a small amount of powdered leaf from the Kratom plant once daily to treat his conditions.\n\nIn October, he stopped taking Kratom for six days and recorded his deteriorating condition to demonstrate “what the reality of a Kratom ban looks like.” On day five, excessive blinking, a twitching brow, and swallowing interrupted his speech. His speech was slow and labored. “This is what I’ll have to face” if Kratom is banned, he says, since “the pharmaceutical measures don’t really help; they typically make these issues a little bit worse.”\n\nBy day 6, a rapid succession of tics pull and twist his facial expressions, and his stuttering is uncontrollable. “If this continues on,” he says, “within a few more days I’ll probably have complete inability to speak…[and] the pain I woke up with this morning was very unbearable.”\n\nThousands Share Andrew Turner’s Story\n\nThough Meige syndrome isn’t common, what binds this veteran’s story to thousands of other testimonies from Kratom users is how taking Kratom has allowed them to stop using prescription opiates, or avoid them altogether. As Turner explains: “For a long time I’ve worked with doctors and the DOD to manage my symptoms…turned out that with just a little bit [of Kratom] each morning, I was able to stop using opiates…large amounts of vicodin, Percosets. I haven’t taken any in months…I can do things on my own again without others helping me.”\n\nMany veterans have found success using Kratom to treat chronic pain and PTSD, as founder of American Kratom Association Susan Ash told U.S. News and many wrote to the DEA when it opened the potential regulations for public comment. Abraham, a former U.S. Army sergeant, wrote, “It is one of the only medicines that help tremendously with my PTSD without being hepatotoxic…I had multiple buddies with whom I worked with who were at risk for suicide. They were introduced to Kratom and now are living normal lives.”\n\nMany veterans’ stories can be found on YouTube under the hashtag #IAmKratom. Josh, a disabled veteran with two back surgeries, anxiety, and PTSD told viewers how he “walked around feeling like a zombie” on the 12 medications the military hospital had prescribed him before he switched to Kratom. “I feel better in these 3 years that I’ve had Kratom than the six years before that,” he said.\n\nCurtis, a disabled infantry Army vet, said he was put on pharmaceuticals to help with PTSD and opiate painkillers to manage his chronic pain. “It was a pretty bad time for me…I decided to give [Kratom] a try, and within the first two hours of having my first spoonful, my pain was almost completely gone. Over the first few weeks, my crushing depression and anxiety had started to go away.” He says now he doesn’t take any other medications and can provide for his family.\n\nAsh says she uses Kratom to treat chronic pain from Lyme disease and broke her addiction to opioids with its help. Many other non-veterans testified to its efficacy in managing pain. One woman, 48, wrote, “I suffer excruciating, haneous [sic], debilitating pain EVERY minute of every day. Kratom stopped it dead in its tracks. I am now LIVING. I work again, I’m a mother again, a wife again.”\n\nIs This Leaf Akin to Heroin or Ecstacy?\n\nThousands of such consumers spoke out when in August 2016 the DEA notified the public of its intent to add the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the Schedule I category, a decision “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.” This would have put the ancient herb from Southeast Asia in such unsavory company as heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, and other drugs determined by the DEA to have, “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”\n\nThe DEA has the power to immediately ban a drug, then issue permits for its use as they see fit. Placing Kratom in the Schedule I category may seem drastic considering its comparatively mild nature to other Schedule I drugs, but that’s the only category into which DEA can place drugs if it wants to ban them quickly without express permission from Congress.\n\nJournalist Anthony Roberts reported that within the first week alone more than 100,000 people signed the petition to keep Kratom unscheduled. More than 23,000 posted comments with overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n\nTurner says vendor sales estimate that between 3 and 5 million people in the United States have tried Kratom, and the market is growing. More than 55, 000 kilograms of dried Kratom leaves and powder have been encountered “at ports of entry” to the United States between 2014 and 2016.\n\nAfter the massive outcry from Kratom users, on October 12, 2016 DEA withdrew its plan to schedule Kratom. Spokesman Melvin Patteson said the reversal is “something we’ve never done before.” DEA opened another public comment period and requested that the Food and Drug Administration do an “8 factor analysis” before making a scheduling decision. That analysis has yet to be conducted, but an eight-factor analysis commissioned by the American Kratom Association and performed by PinneyAssociates found Kratom “appears overall much safer [than opioids].”\n\nAccording to Dr. Jack Henningfield, one of the analysis’ authors, “Its favorable safety profile supports continued access by consumers to appropriately regulated products while research on its uses continues.” So prospects look brighter for the botanical than they did just a few months ago.\n\nOther Benefits and Effects of Kratom\n\nThe leaves of the plant in question (Mitragyna Speciosa) have purportedly been used by natives for millennia and, more recently, by U.S. consumers for its calming and analgesic properties; often as an alternative to prescription opioids.\n\nKratom is fairly inexpensive. A low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain. One Kratom user wrote her medications for managing the pain of fibromyalgia were “more than her disability check.” “It’s such a cheap substance,” explains Turner, “You’re not going to have people breaking into homes to finance their Kratom habit.”\n\nPrevious analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester of personal experiences aggregated on Erowid.org (“a psychoactive substance information site”) found among Kratom’s effects, “what appears to be a mild (i.e., relative to opiates) dependence syndrome.”\n\nA low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain.\n\nBut some Kratom users report dependency as a real struggle, some saying it suppresses their creativity and heightens complacency. One user who described himself as “addicted to Kratom for 2 and a half years, typically at 20-25 grams a day” commented on Reddit, “Kratom made me complacent and sloppy, but also stifled my creativity. It’s funny how when you are on kratom your standards sink so low. There’s this weird complacency like ‘since I feel good anything I do is good enough.’”\n\nAnother quitter described the plant as “the green deception” and “a puppeteer.” Still another recreational user reported insomnia, depression, anxiety, and hot and cold sweats while withdrawing from use of 8-12g a day—an amount Turner equates to “shoveling it down” and “chasing a big-time high.” Other users report consumption upwards of 30g a day.\n\nReddit contains multiple threads of negative Kratom experiences, especially withdrawal symptoms. Notably, many are from users who do not report using Kratom to treat pre-existing conditions, report consuming very high doses, or are also on other medications (for instance, the user who reported insomnia was also taking Prozac). Such instances would support the DEA’s position that Kratom is “being abused for its opioid-like properties.”\n\n“It still has risks just like anything one ingests,” Turner said, warning against trying Kratom before doing the research or “chasing a high that just really isn’t there.” “There is no actual high from kratom that you could dare compare to even the mildest opiate,” Ash told U.S. News.\n\nIn low doses (roughly 2-4g), Kratom has a stimulating and “uplifting” effect, and some consumers say it gives them focus and a slight boost of motivation. In higher doses, it tends to act as a depressant and an analgesic, and it is the efficacy of Kratom in this regard that recovering opioid addicts generally testify to. Of all the appeals to keeping Kratom legal, its ability to decrease or eliminate opioid users’ dependence is the strongest.\n\nKratom Could Be an Exit-Ramp Drug\n\nOne man, who became addicted to opium poppies and then to heroin, said of the plant: “Kratom took someone who had no desire, at all, to stop using opiates and allowed me to quit heroin cold turkey, and remain opiate-free for over six years (and counting).”\n\nKristofer also described his experience breaking free of narcotics, “the side effects [from his medication] were absolutely awful…I was headed to the point where I was going to have to be on disability for the rest of my life. I started supplementing Kratom into my diet as needed, and it completely changed my life as well. I have experienced zero side effects, and it has helped me turn my life around to the point where I am able to work a full time job (40 hours+ a week), and provide for my family like I have never been able to do before.”\n\nNarcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nThe nation is in the throes of an opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that more than 33,000 people died from opioid use in 2015, an increase of 72 percent from the previous year, and a figure almost on par with the total traffic fatalities for the same year (35,000). Prescription opioids are powerful, and powerfully addictive. The prescription drug fentanyl, for instance, is “50 times more powerful than heroin,” as noted by CNN. Narcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nSuch highly addictive painkillers as OxyContin and Codeine are the widest gateway to heroin addiction. Amid this overwhelming opiate crisis, the DEA attempted to schedule Kratom as a drug with “no medical use,” with “no investigational new drug applications or approved new drug applications” for its main alkaloids, although the authors of the DEA’s three-factor analysis of Kratom acknowledged the plant’s analgesic properties and noted “Kratom has also been used to self-treat chronic pain and withdrawal symptoms from opioid misuse and dependence.”\n\nThe DEA also cites in the same document the increasing number of Kratom-positive blood or urine samples at private labs, which has gone from 31 positive results in 2012 to 555 positive results for 2015 through March 2016. DEA says this demonstrates rising concern over “the growing abuse” of Kratom products. The administration also cites a “tenfold increase in the number of calls received [at poison control centers] between 2010 and 2015” as evidence of growing Kratom abuse.\n\nCompare Kratom’s Effects to Those of Competing Drugs\n\nOf course, the strongest evidence supporting their case that Kratom use constitutes an “emerging public health threat” would presumable be 30 “Kratom associated deaths,” for all recorded years.\n\nThe DEA’s notice of intent and three-factor analysis calls all Kratom users “abusers.” But “abuser” isn’t found in the list of legal terms for the Controlled Substances Act; neither the FDA nor the DEA have a legal definition for “abuse,” much less “high potential for abuse.” The terms “abuse” and “abuser” are political, flexible enough to fit over an entire group of consumers regardless of the method or purpose of the product’s usage by the individual.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom.\n\nBut to compare Kratom abuse to that of opioids, we’ll employ a common definition of drug abuse, such as, “Compulsive, excessive, and self-damaging use of habit forming drugs or substances, leading to addiction or dependence.”\n\nAccording to national survey data from the Department of Health and Human Services, substance abuse for prescription pain relievers totaled roughly 2 million, and substance abuse for heroin totaled about 591,000 in 2015. That same year, there were, “20,101 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 12,990 overdose deaths related to heroin,” according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Of course, the most obvious sign of abuse are overdose fatalities: ODs from prescription pain relievers quadrupled between 1999 and 2014.\n\nBy contrast, the DEA could point to only 30 recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. According to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. Also, in all but one of those deaths, other substances were found in the systems of the deceased, (including amphetamine, heroin, methadone, and fentanyl).\n\nAs for other indicators of Kratom abuse, 660 Kratom-related calls to poison control centers were recorded between 2010 and 2015. But the CDC study of these calls the DEA cites, by their own admission, determines a correlation between the 50 severe outcomes “and exposure to Kratom plus other substances.” The three-factor analysis could point to a few cases, but no statistics or aggregate data, on other indicators for abuse, such as emergency room admissions or treatment facility admissions.\n\nHow About Regulating Before Banning?\n\nEven if one disputes the DEA’s claim that Kratom is widely abused, the Kratom market is “the wild west” in terms of regulation, as Turner acknowledges. The three-factor analysis notes that Kratom products are often marketed as a “legal high,” and falsely labeled. There is no recommended dosage amount, either. The DEA’s original scheduling notice cited lack of regulation as one of Kratom’s dangers.\n\nYet why try to ban Kratom before considering common-sense regulations? Turner said he and many other Kratom advocates would like to see more common-sense regulation of Kratom, such as restricting the age for purchase to 21 and over, and ensuring the Kratom supply isn’t tainted with harmful chemicals and that the contents are true to the advertised ingredients.\n\nA first step toward this end would be submitting Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient” to the FDA, which includes submitting evidence that Kratom is safe to consume. “I’d love to see the government come in and say we need to have some testing. I’m okay with some oversight,” says Turner, “But there’s a fine line between oversight and overreach.”\n\nWhy Did the DEA Try to Ban Kratom?\n\nWhen the government attempts to ban a substance seemingly out of nowhere, without previous widespread media coverage of the issue or public outcry, often the first suspects are other key players in the industry.\n\nJournalists and Kratom advocates have pointed to Dr. Daniel Fabricant as a force behind the proposed ban, as arguably Kratom’s most outspoken critic. In 2014, Fabricant directed the FDA’s dietary supplements division, and that year the FDA began seizing Kratom imports. In April 2014, however, Fabricant became CEO of the Natural Products Association. NPA senior vice president Corey Hilmas is also an FDA transplant.\n\n‘If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement.’\n\nSince 2014, Fabricant has been nudging regulators to crack down on Kratom. I spoke to Dr. Fabricant, who maintains the botanical should still be scheduled because it exhibits opiate-like behavior.\n\n“If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement,” he said. He chastised advocates for self-treatment. “You’re going to self-diagnose treatment of addiction? There’s no a magic bullet for addiction. People from addiction clinics have said people do get addicted to Kratom. You should be working hand in hand with a health-care provider.”\n\nEven regarding the potential submission of Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient,” he explained that the substance, “has to show baseline acute safety, they have to do a toxicity study…and the extra-curricular question is: is it addictive.” In his view, that question is essential. If we do place preference studies for things that sweeten our coffee, why wouldn’t we do that for Kratom?\n\nFabricant comes across as passionate and sincere about his position. It’s worth noting, however, that some of the NPA’s member companies make and sell products that compete with Kratom (such as “At Ease” and “Brain Awakening,” and formulas for clear thinking or muscle spasms and tension) and would have an interest in how the botanical is regulated.\n\n“It’s more likely that it’s a fear held by the dietary companies,” said Charles Haddow, a representative from the American Kratom Association, “that if it’s as bad people are saying, that there will be a spillover that affects the division…if there are deaths, that it might bring calls to Congress calling for a new regulatory scheme for the industry.”\n\nStill, it’s not as if the Kratom importers and retailers don’t have financial interests at stake in this regulatory battle. “People supporting Kratom are making a lot of money, but they chastise makers of opiates for the same,” Fabricant pointed out. And research to ensure Kratom’s safety costs money, as the CEO acknowledged. But he insisted the Kratom industry isn’t stepping up and taking responsibility in that regard.\n\nChief Opponents Include Competing Substance Companies\n\nIn July of 2013, three organizations—the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, and the United Natural Products Alliance—sent a letter to the FDA expressing concern over Kratom’s lack of regulation. It certainly seems concern from the pharmaceutical and supplement industries triggered the FDA’s interest in Kratom. The FDA’s database reveals no documents about Kratom until a September 2014 news release regarding a Kratom seizure in southern California, and all the firms on the list of products Subject to Detention without Physical Examination under the import alert have dates published 2014 or after.\n\nCross-referencing the members listed for each organization with a 2012 report on narcotics manufacturers from United Nation’s Office of Drugs and Crime, it is revealed that the Council for Responsible Nutrition represents the pharmaceutical companies BASF, which manufactures the psychoactive stimulants cathine and methcathinone, and the opiate painkiller Tilidine; DSM Nutritional Products, which manufactures Bromazepam, Clonazepam, and Diazepam; and Lonza Inc., which makes the depressant GHB and methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat ADHD.\n\nThese drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its ‘perks,’ such as focus and energy.\n\nCHPA represents Chattem Chemicals (a division of Sun Pharma), which manufactures codeine, fentanyl, methadone, morphone, oxycodone, sufentanil; and Purdue Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of OxyContin. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also a member through their division “Teva Women’s Health”; Teva makes a generic for Actiq, a drug containing fentanyl, as well as oxycodone tablets.\n\nThe UNPA represents companies on the natural side of the industry, including Indena USA, which makes extracts from plants like chamomile and Devil’s Claw (used to treat muscle and back pain and migraines), and Morinda, which sells “natural” products, including energy drinks and focus supplements. These drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its “perks,” such as focus and energy.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies are heavyweights: BASF is No. 94 on Forbes’ list of the world’s biggest companies, and in 2015 its nutrition and health products generated 2.1 billion. Purdue generates about $3 billion in revenue annually, mostly from OxyContin sales. Chattem’s parent company, Sun Pharma, brought in about $403 million from U.S. sales in 2013.\n\nWhy wouldn’t these companies monetize the herb themselves instead of pushing for a ban? I asked Turner. Certainly their R&D budgets could create a Kratom product superior to a bitter green powder shipped to consumers in unmarked Ziploc bags or sold as powder capsules in head shops.\n\nLarge pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market.\n\nYet the number of alkaloids in the Kratom leaf (37, according to Fabricant, but sources differ) and their short shelf life once extracted would make manufacturing a synthetic version quite difficult. Even if such companies were selling simple extracts or powder capsules, Turner explained, it would take decades to grow a commercially viable domestic crop, and in the necessary tropical climates like Hawaii or Guam. Large-scale importation would be expensive to start up, too, especially with pre-existing regulatory barriers: the FDA would first need to approve Kratom as a safe dietary ingredient.\n\nTo complicate matters, regulators might require Kratom sellers to change the formulation to sell kratom products as supplements. According to Fabricant, that would mean they’d have to make an extract without the “addictive” main alkaloids. This would be another expensive step, and might render the product impotent.\n\nSo large pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market. Prescription narcotics bring in significant revenue. Pain medications are a $24 billion global market and Kratom’s position as a more tolerable and effective analgesic for many cuts in on the market.\n\nDespite the DEA’s scheduling halt, the FDA has already ordered more seizures of products containing Kratom this year.\n\nWhat About Approval Through the FDA?\n\nThe agencies that regulate what Americans put into their bodies operate on the assumption that anything that is not scientifically proven safe, to varying degrees of satisfaction as determined by the agencies, must be dangerous. As such, it would be more challenging for drug companies to convince the FDA that Kratom is safe, versus convincing them it is dangerous enough to ban.\n\nWhen attempting to enter the market, government agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise. Hence the lengthy clinical trials and years-long waits for FDA approval. To draw a comparison to criminal court: the drug (or dietary supplement) is guilty until proven innocent.\n\nGovernment agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise.\n\nNow, for experimental drugs synthesized in a lab, this makes a great deal of sense. Its potential effects are unknown, or close to it, and to immediately bottle it up and sell it to sick people would be preposterous. The length and breadth of the clinical trials may be up for debate, but testing isn’t just responsible, it’s an ethical obligation.\n\nBut Kratom isn’t an experimental drug, and its effects aren’t unknown. Its psychoactive nature may make some doctors and regulators nervous, but the plant has been used for centuries, and people are using it currently with overwhelmingly positive results.\n\nThe regulatory overseers, however, aren’t satisfied with history and anecdotes. Kratom sellers haven’t supplied the toxicity and place preference studies the FDA would want. Other scientific research is preliminary, but university research indicates Kratom’s main alkaloid, mitragynine, could indeed provide an effective “step-down” from opiate addiction.\n\nBut government science gets it wrong often enough to warrant serious doubts about its competence in regulating, or even advising, on our behaviors and consumption. Consider that it took the National Institute of Health nearly a decade to reverse guidelines on peanut allergies in children after the first studies challenging the wisdom of their approach were published, or the inflated place of dairy in both the old food pyramid and the new “myPlate” guidelines, or the fact that the FDA has set new sodium guidelines for food companies, despite strong evidence that sodium really isn’t all that harmful.\n\nHow About Aiming for Harm Reduction over Abstinence\n\nAbstinence is the chief principle governing the drug war that surrounds Kratom, leading to crackdowns on behaviors as mild as marijuana use, coming down hardest on the suppliers, but punishing users, too. One nurse of 26 years opined, somewhat hyperbolically, that if the DEA really wanted to make a difference, they would dispense Kratom to addicts “who want to get off that destructive merry go round.”\n\nAn agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose.\n\nFabricant believes “We didn’t get to have the safest food supply in the world by letting anyone dump something into the market just because they feel strongly about it.” But Turner is convinced it would be “detrimental to public health” to ban Kratom. To him, enforcing complete abstinence from a substance that is not well-researched in the lab, but that has been overwhelmingly beneficial in the real world, isn’t the answer.\n\n“The addicts have a true chance to get clean,” he said. “There are questions with Kratom, about dependency, but at the end of the day it’s not going to kill anybody.”\n\nThe vast regulatory state, with its lack of accountability to both legislators and the public, and its shared pool of expertise with the private sector it purports to regulate, is ripe for exploitation. An agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose. In the case of Kratom, many of those consumers are suffering and even more vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe fate of Kratom is still in limbo. But may the plant’s close brush with regulatory disaster be a lesson to citizens: the government doesn’t always hold our best interests as a top priority.\n\nGeorgi is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist and host of The 180 Cast , where she interviews people who have changed their minds on important political and social issues.

         "Sources: US enforcement of Iran arms embargo slipped during nuclear talks",
         "WASHINGTON - Addressing concerns that a landmark nuclear deal reached this year could boost Iran's military power, the Obama administration reassured critics that it would maintain and enforce its remaining tough sanctions against the country Yet the US government has pursued far fewer violations of a long-standing arms embargo against Iran in the past year compared to recent years, according to a review of court records and interviews with two senior officials involved in sanctions enforcement.The sharp fall in new prosecutions did not reflect fewer attempts by Iran to break the embargo, the officials said. Rather, uncertainty among prosecutors and agents on how the terms of the deal would affect cases made them reluctant to commit already scarce resources with the same vigor as in previous years, the officials said.\n\nStay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nThe more relaxed enforcement raises questions over how strictly the arms embargo and other remaining sanctions will be applied in future, since the nuclear deal still needs to be implemented and Iran will likely remain sensitive to a tough sanctions regime.In the 2014-15 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, US law enforcement officials filed fresh charges just twice against those suspected of attempting to smuggle weapons and related technology from the United States to Iran, according to court records.Eight such cases were brought in 2013-14. By comparison, around 10 to 12 such cases were brought in each of the preceding six years.\"There's been a precipitous drop-off,\" said one of the senior US officials, who declined to be identified. \"The facts are the facts - there's no other explanation.\"The official added there was already a \"reticence\" in some agencies and US federal prosecutors' offices to pursue the cases because they are so tough to build and time-consuming.\"And if we're going to normalize things with Iran soon, people are asking, 'Is it worth it?'\"The nuclear deal, reached in July after two years of concerted negotiations, tasks Iran with dismantling much of its nuclear infrastructure in return for the removal of many of the international sanctions placed on it over the past five years.The US sanctions being lifted are largely nuclear-related measures that barred other countries from dealing with Iran's banking and oil sectors.US sanctions for Iran's alleged human rights violations and support for militant groups remain in place, as do measures barring US persons from most trade with Iran. A United Nations embargo on conventional weapons will be lifted in five years, and a UN embargo on ballistic missiles in eight.Multiple US laws and regulations still bar the export of US goods and technology to Iran, especially anything related to defense.Obama administration officials say they continued to aggressively enforce sanctions against Iran throughout the negotiations, are still doing so, and will strictly enforce the remaining sanctions after the deal is implemented.\"The Justice Department continues to pursue criminal prosecutions against those that seek to circumvent US sanctions involving Iran and other export controls,\" said Marc Raimondi, a spokesman for the department, adding there were numerous ongoing cases.A senior Commerce Department official said its Office of Export Enforcement \"continues to vigorously enforce sanctions on Iran\" and that Iran cases make up the bulk of its current file.A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a Department of Homeland Security agency, did not respond to a request for comment.Elizabeth Bourassa, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said the department had enforced sanctions at the same pace since a framework deal was announced with Iran in April as it did in the preceding year and a half.Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) enforces a wide variety of sanctions beyond non-proliferation, including financial, terrorism, and oil measures.\"Since the start of the negotiating period, OFAC imposed sanctions on more than 100 Iran-related individuals and entities, concluded more than 20 Iran-related enforcement actions, and assessed approximately $525 million in penalties for violations of Iran-related sanctions,\" Bourassa said.",

         "McConnell Would Fill Potential Supreme Court Vacancy In 2020, Reversal Of 2016 Stance\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIn 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to hold a hearing on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, saying that it was an election year and that the American people \"deserved a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nThat was then.\n\nSpeaking to an audience in Kentucky on Monday, McConnell said should a vacancy occur on the court in 2020, another presidential election year, he would allow a vote.\n\nHe was asked at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon: \"Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMcConnell responded with a grin, \"Oh, we'd fill it.\"\n\nThe comments were first reported by CNN.\n\nMcConnell has made similar pronouncements in the past, noting that the nomination of Merrick Garland by Obama came during a time of divided government and that should a vacancy occur with President Trump in the White House and the Senate also under GOP control, circumstances would be different.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to McConnell on Twitter, calling him \"a hypocrite\"\n\nMcConnell's office argued Wednesday morning that his comments were not inconsistent.\n\n\"The Leader has noted on multiple occasions that not since the 1880s has a 'vacancy created in a presidential year' been 'confirmed by the party opposite the occupant of the White House.' His comments in Paducah yesterday simply repeated this. If there is a vacancy next year, because the White House and the Senate are the same party, we would vote to fill the slot,\" McConnell's staff director wrote in an email to reporters listing previous statements.\n\nIn his remarks to the luncheon on Tuesday, McConnell stressed the importance he places on putting conservatives in judgeships, even more than legislative accomplishments.\n\n\"What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\" McConnell said. \"That's the most important thing we've done for the country, which cannot be undone.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere are two justices on the high court who are in their 80s, and Democrats have worried for some time about the health of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. By denying Garland a seat, McConnell has assured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a foreseeable future, with the confirmations of Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and of Brett Kavanaugh last year.",

         "Story highlights Commander Yusuf Abdi Ali is accused of \"overseeing some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine.\" He has been quietly living in the U.S. for 20 years. He passed a background check to work at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nCNN —\n\nAn accused war criminal living in the United States is now working as a security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nA CNN investigation found that Yusuf Abdi Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities while he was a military commander during Somalia’s brutal civil war, has been living a quiet life near the nation’s capital for about 20 years.\n\nHe is just one of more than 1,000 accused war criminals living and working in the United States.\n\nMass graves and haunting stories\n\nCourtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Mass grave reveals Somalia's bloody past Prev Next\n\nIn a shallow pit in northern Somalia, forensic anthropologists have been delicately digging around battered bones that were recently found in numerous mass graves. They’re the remains of a clan slaughtered during the war in the 1980s, alleged evidence of the brutality carried out by the government regime in power at the time.\n\nLed by Mohamed Siad Barre, the regime took over Somalia after a coup in 1969 and ruled with an iron fist. In the north, the dominant Isaaq clan was heavily repressed and brutalized by government forces, according to human rights experts.\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali served as a commander in the Barre regime and is accused of terrorizing the Isaaq people, torturing clan members, burning villages and conducting mass executions.\n\nSeveral villagers described these atrocities in a documentary that aired on the Canadian network CBC in 1992. One witness claimed Ali captured and killed a family member.\n\n“He tied (my brother) to military vehicle and dragged him behind. He said to us if you’ve got enough power, get him back,” the villager said. “He shredded him into pieces. That’s how he died.”\n\nCNN found that, today, Ali is living a normal suburban life just outside of the nation’s capital, in Alexandria, VA. He shares an apartment with his wife and works as a security guard at Dulles, one of the busiest airports in the country.\n\nAs a result of CNN’s investigation, Ali has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nSomali President Mohamed Siad Barre in May 1990. MIKE NELSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAli’s employer Master Security has a contract with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to provide unarmed security services. Ali passed a “full, federally mandated vetting process” that included an FBI background check and a TSA assessment.\n\nHowever, when CNN initially asked Master Security about Ali, the company said it was “unaware of the pending litigation.”\n\nIn light of the “very serious nature of the allegations,” Ali is on administrative leave, and the company is reviewing the case, according to Chief Executive Rick Cucina. Ali’s airport access has also been withdrawn.\n\nThe case against Ali\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali\n\nAli is being sued in a U.S. civil court. The lawsuit, which a human rights group initially filed in 2006, calls Ali a “war criminal” who committed “crimes against humanity.”\n\n“He oversaw some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine,” said Kathy Roberts, an attorney for the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), which is leading the civil suit. “He tortured people personally; he oversaw torture.”\n\nThe case has had numerous twists and appeals over the years. The most recent happened in February, when the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only part of the case can move forward – the lawsuit’s claims that Ali tortured and attempted to murder the plaintiff. The other part of the suit – claims that he committed “war crimes” – cannot because those alleged crimes happened outside of the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to hear it, it could become a landmark case over whether foreigners living in the U.S. can be held accountable for crimes allegedly committed overseas.\n\nRoberts claims Ali is directly responsible for these atrocities, painting disturbing images of acts he allegedly committed.\n\nRebels of Somali National Movement (SNM) sit on their beds in November 1989 in Leila, northern Somalia. ALEXANDER JOE/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“He arrested people, stole their stuff, burned villages, executed masses of people,” Roberts said. “At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nAli and his lawyer, Joseph Peter Drennan, deny all accusations listed in the CJA lawsuit.\n\nWhen CNN approached Ali outside his apartment in Alexandria, he declined an interview, telling correspondent Kyra Phillips: “To tell you the truth, all is false. Baseless.”\n\n“How dare anyone call him a war criminal,” Drennan told CNN. “Those are just allegations. If he is indeed a war criminal, take him to The Hague. Or if he is a war criminal, take it up with the immigration authorities. Don’t sue him in an American court… My client deserves to live in the U.S. just as any other legal permanent resident.”\n\nHowever, there is no criminal court in the world that can try Ali for war crimes. One key reason for this is that no criminal court really has jurisdiction to do so.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague wasn’t formally envisioned until 1994, following the genocide in Rwanda. The ICC didn’t issue its first arrest warrants until a decade later.\n\n“At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nOther special war crimes or genocide tribunals, such as those in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Cambodia, were only created for the specific areas where those crimes took place. Somalia has never been able to develop a complete justice system that could embark on such a tribunal.\n\nThe U.S. doesn’t have jurisdiction over the events that played out in Somalia in the 1980s, even though Ali has ties to the U.S. military. At the time, the Siad Barre government was a U.S. ally. Thus, American officials considered many military soldiers and commanders, including Ali, to be fighting for U.S. interests.\n\nDrennan asks: If the Defense Department had no problem with Ali, why should anyone else?\n\n“My client has never been adjudicated to have committed any wrongful acts of any sort, much less be correctly seen as a war criminal,” Drennan said. “He is not a war criminal.”\n\nThe U.S. government says its investigators have been aware of Ali for years, “based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, officials refused to provide further details.\n\nThe suspected war criminals among us\n\nAli is just one of many people who are living in the United States despite being accused of committing some of the worst violence in modern times.\n\nThese people – most of whom are men – are accused of crimes such as mass murder in El Salvador; torture and murder in Chile; ethnic cleansing in Somalia. Some are even wanted in their homelands, with outstanding extradition requests to remove them from the U.S. so they can be held accountable for their crimes.\n\nYet they continue to lead typical American lives, with some even working jobs in high-profile positions.\n\n“There’s about 1,000 suspected perpetrators in the United States,” Roberts said.\n\nRoberts and CJA say Americans should know that accused war criminals and suspected human rights violators are living across the country.\n\n“It fundamentally violates what we could call American values,” Roberts said. “But I really would rather say human values – to allow people like this to get off scot-free, and to allow them to benefit from the rule of law that they deprived their victims of, and they need to be held accountable.”\n\nAli ended up in Canada after the Barre military regime collapsed in 1991. But he was deported several years later after news about his alleged war crimes in Somalia became public through the CBC documentary.\n\nAli entered the U.S. on a visa through his Somali wife, Intisar Farah, who became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, she was found guilty of naturalization fraud for claiming she was a refugee from the very Somali clan that Ali is accused of torturing.\n\nFrom Somalia to Dulles\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali, working security at Dulles International Airport. CNN\n\nDrennan said there should be no concerns whatsoever that Ali was working at an airport. Roberts, however, disagrees.\n\n“It’s very deeply disturbing, in part because that is a position of trust,” she said. “He abused that authority terribly in Somalia, and while I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\n“… While I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials declined to comment on Ali’s case, or on other alleged war criminals, but they did confirm that he was known to the agency.\n\nIn a statement ICE wrote: “Yusuf Ali came to the attention of investigators and attorneys within the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, ICE’s legacy agency, based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, ICE officials would not clarify why Ali has been allowed to remain in the U.S.\n\nIn the last 12 years, ICE’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center has arrested more than 360 people “for human rights-related violations.” The agency has also removed more than 780 known or suspected human rights violators from the U.S. It currently has more than 125 active investigations.",

         "Story highlights NEW: Multiple officials identify the shooter as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer Ten people were killed and another seven were injured, sheriff says Thoughts and prayers are \"not enough,\" says President Barack Obama\n\nCNN —\n\n[Breaking news update 11:38 p.m. ET]\n\nThe gunman who opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College targeted Christians specifically, according to the father of a wounded student.\n\nBefore going into spinal surgery, Anastasia Boylan told her father and brother the gunman entered her classroom firing. The professor in the classroom was shot point blank. Others were hit, she told her family.\n\nEveryone in the classroom dropped to the ground.\n\nThe gunman, while reloading his handgun, ordered the students to stand up if they were Christians, Boylan told her family.\n\n“And they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,’” Boylan’s father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account.\n\n“And then he shot and killed them.”\n\n[Last update posted at 11:28 p.m. ET]\n\n(CNN ) – Ten people were killed when a gunman opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College on Thursday, forcing the nation to face yet another mass shooting.\n\nSeven other people were injured, and the shooter is dead, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters. Earlier estimates had put the number of people hurt much higher.\n\nMultiple law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Investigators have interviewed members of his family and friends, they said.\n\n“I will not name the shooter,” Hanlin said. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought.”\n\nAuthorities credited a quick response by law enforcement for keeping the death toll from climbing higher.\n\nA law enforcement official said the shooter had body armor with him and was heavily armed, with a large amount of ammunition – enough for a prolonged gunfight.\n\nHanlin said tactical teams and bomb squads had cleared the buildings on campus and were working to clear hundreds of vehicles parked on campus.\n\nHuddled together\n\nCassandra Welding is a student at the Roseburg campus and was in class when the shooting started.\n\n“I heard a popping noise, almost like a balloon popping,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I knew something wasn’t right and so I get down.”\n\nShe said all of the students in her classroom dropped to the ground. They huddled together behind backpacks and chairs, underneath tables.\n\n“We locked the doors, turned off the lights, and we were all pretty much in panic mode,” Welding said.\n\n“We called 911 and called our parents, our loved ones … We didn’t know what was going to happen, if those were our last words or not.”\n\nCommunity members attend a candlelight vigil at Stewart Park for those killed during a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday, October 1. The massacre left nine people dead and nine wounded. The gunman also died.

Aaron Yost/The News-Review/AP Shooting at Oregon community college Prev Next\n\nThe shooting\n\nThe shooting appears to have started in one building before the gunman moved to the school’s science building, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Those killed and wounded were found in at least two classrooms.\n\n“We arrived to find multiple patients in multiple classrooms. Law enforcement was on scene and had the shooter neutralized,” said Douglas County Fire Marshal Ray Shoufler.\n\nHe told CNN that two patients died while being transported to a hospital.\n\nMercy Medical Center posted on Facebook that it had received 10 patients. The extent of their injuries was not known.\n\nThree female victims were at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield, according to a hospital spokeswoman.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear why the hospitals’ numbers conflicted with the figure provided by Sheriff Hanlin.\n\nA law enforcement official told CNN three pistols and one rifle believed to have belonged to the suspect were recovered at the scene.\n\nATF agents were also on scene and canine teams were en route to search for explosives, fire arms casings and ammunition, a spokesman said. FBI agents were en route.\n\nThe community\n\nRoseburg is a city of about 22,000 people about 70 miles south of Eugene, Oregon, and some 180 miles south of Portland.\n\nThe school itself is up on a hill outside the city center, according to Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst who lives nearby. Francona said that logging is a big industry in the region, which is fairly rural but easily accessible from Interstate 5.\n\nOregon shooting shatters ‘peaceful’ enclave\n\n“This is so out of character for this whole area,” he said.\n\nNews of the shooting quickly reached Washington, with the state’s senior senator, Ron Wyden, visibly shaken and Sen. Jeff Merkley tweeting that he was praying for the victims and their families.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation and will continue to receive updates throughout the day.\n\nHe pushed for a change in gun laws when he spoke to reporters about the shooting Thursday.\n\n“Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this,” he said.\n\nThe President continued: “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America – next week, or a couple months from now.”\n\nThe school\n\nA picturesque campus in the North Umpqua River Valley, Umpqua Community College prides itself on a “a peaceful, safe atmosphere, and year-round recreational activities,” according to its website.\n\nIt’s not a traditional institution of higher learning, as the average age of its 13,600 students was 38 during the 2013-2014 school year. Only 740 of those were full time, 2,437 were part time and more than 10,000 fell under the umbrella of “community education.”\n\nIt first began teaching classes out of rented facilities in 1961. Elton and Ruth Jackson donated 98.5 acres to house the campus in 1965.\n\nThe school will be closed until Monday as a result of the shooting.\n\nThe interim leader of Umpqua Community College called Thursday “the saddest day in the history of the college.”\n\nAre you there?

         "Calling Nurse A 'Hero,' Utah Hospital Bars Police From Patient-Care Areas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP\n\nUpdated 8:35 p.m. ET\n\nThe Salt Lake City hospital where a police officer roughly arrested a nurse who was protecting her patient's rights in July will no longer allow law enforcement agents inside its patient care areas. They'll now have to check in rather than enter through the emergency room.\n\n\"Law enforcement who come to the hospital for any reason involving patients will be required to check in to the front desk of the hospital,\" said chief nursing officer Margaret Pearce of the University of Utah Hospital. \"There, a hospital house supervisor will meet the officers to work through each request.\"\n\nHospital officials say they created the policy one day after the July incident in which nurse Alex Wubbels refused to allow a police investigator identified as Jeff Payne to get a blood sample from a patient who was injured in a deadly collision with another driver. Wubbels was following the hospital's policy (and a recent Supreme Court decision) that requires either a warrant, the patient's consent or the patient being under arrest for such a sample to be obtained legally.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment bars blood tests from being obtained without a warrant in drunken-driving cases.\n\n\"Our hospital continues to offer our full support to Alex,\" said Gordon Crabtree, the hospital system's CEO. \"I think many of you know she is an Olympian, and to us she's truly an Olympic-size hero. We extend our appreciation for her dedication and service.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile Wubbels' superiors said she had shown professional integrity and grace under fire, the officer's bosses and Salt Lake City's mayor have issued apologies for his behavior. He is on administrative leave while the case is being investigated.\n\nThe encounter between Wubbels and Payne took place on July 26 — but it made headlines last Thursday, when body camera footage of the dispute was released. The video shows Wubbels referring to her hospital's privacy policy and speaking with a supervisor on her cellphone as she denies the officer's request for a blood sample from a patient.\n\nHaving failed to persuade Wubbels to allow him to obtain blood from the patient, the officer begins grabbing at the nurse and then forcefully pulls her outside the hospital as she yells for help. He then handcuffs her and puts her in a police car parked at the hospital.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Our team was advocating for the immediate release of Alex and was ultimately successful in getting her released from the handcuffs and the car,\" Crabtree said on Monday. \"Alex was never charged and will not have a record.\"\n\nOther hospitals will very likely want to adopt similar policies to prevent police overreach, Crabtree said.\n\nPearce said she was \"appalled\" at the encounter. She added:\n\n\"We are a Level 1 Trauma Center with the only dedicated burn unit in the Mountain West region and we have some of the sickest patients anywhere. Because of this, we work with law enforcement on a regular basis for a variety of reasons and will continue to do so. However, I consider the way in which Alex was treated to be totally unacceptable. No individual in a role of patient care should ever be treated in this fashion.\"\n\nThe new policy \"was written the day after this incident\" and was implemented within weeks, Pearce said. Here's how she described the goals for the change:\n\nAllow front-line patient care staff to focus on their work.\n\nPrevent disputes from taking place inside patient care units.\n\nEnsure only \"highly trained people\" work through such issues.\n\nAs we've reported, Wubbels is a former two-time Olympic skier.\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department says it suspended Payne from its \"blood draw program,\" in which it trains officers to take blood samples. It adds that it updated its policies for officers who remain in the group.\n\nPayne has also been fired from his part-time paramedic job with a private ambulance service.\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake City Tribune, the patient in question was truck driver William Gray — who also works as a reserve police officer in Rigby, Idaho, and whose tractor-trailer collided with a vehicle that was being pursued by police.\n\nCiting Payne's police report, the Tribune describes the highway crash that led to the hospital confrontation:\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"At about 2 p.m. on July 26, Gray was driving a semi north on State Road 89/91 near Sardine Canyon when a man fleeing from the Utah Highway Patrol crashed a pickup truck into him head-on, according to Logan police, who investigated the collision.\n\n\"The crash caused an explosion and fire, Logan police have said. Gray was on fire when he exited the semi. The driver of the pickup truck, Marcos Torres, 26, died at the scene.\"",

         "Mary Bowerman, USA TODAY Network\n\nA Florida woman who believes the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting is a hoax was arrested Monday on charges she threatened the parent of a child killed in the 2012 school shooting.\n\nLucy Richards, 57, of Tampa, Fla., was indicted on four counts of transmitting threats, according to a statement from the United States Attorney Southern District of Florida.\n\nThe Sandy Hook shooting is approaching its fourth anniversary. On Dec. 14, 2012, 20 children and six school staffers were fatally shot at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. By Adam Lanza, 20. Lanza later fatally shot himself.\n\nAccording to authorities, Richards made a series of death threats against Len Pozner, the parent of a child who was killed in the shooting.\n\nSandy Hook mom sent this message to Orlando victims\n\nRichards is accused of telling the parent “you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon,\" according to federal court documents. The statements were made in January. She also wrote, \"Look behind you it's death,\" according to the documents.\n\nPozner addressed Richards' arrest in a statement.\n\n\"We are comforted to know that the system is working to protect the victims of violent crime from re-victimization by potentially violent Hoaxers,\" Pozner said.\n\nIf convicted of all four counts, Richards could face up to 20 years in prison. She is scheduled to appear in a Fort Lauderdale court on Dec. 19.\n\nMr. Trump, denounce Alex Jones: Sandy Hook principal's daughter\n\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman",

         "News Articles On ‘Child Suicide Game’ Targeting Vulnerable Parents Share:\n\nVULNERABLE parents as young as 15 are being warned of the dangers of ‘clickbait’ style news articles designed to spread fear and panic around a self-harming game called ‘Momo’, WWN can confirm.\n\nExperts have warned children that the majority of the news articles depict an image of a distorted woman with sensational headlines and can lure parents into a state of panic in a matter of seconds.\n\n“If you see your parent reading such articles please reassure them that everything is going to be okay,” said chief executive of WebSafe Ireland, Thomas Jockey. “Parents may go temporarily insane and start searching through your devices and there may also be a period of time that your YouTube app will be deleted in exchange for the Kids YouTube app, but don’t worry; this is only temporary”.\n\nThe articles, which have now gone more viral than the game they’re covering thus exposing millions of children to something they had never heard of before, feature across all mainstream media platforms and are more or less worded in the same scaremongering style and come with thousands of naive comments from parents.\n\n“I caught my mother searching through my iPad and had to have ‘the talk’ with her,” explains 7-year-old Saoirse Hogan from Lucan, “once you explain that you’re not that stupid as to go harm yourself over a stupid game, then they seem to calm down a bit,” adding, “Sure God bless their cotton socks, if they only knew the real life stuff online we’d be watching, they’d actually have reason to be scared”.",

         "3 Californias? The initiative to break up the state may be on the ballot in November",
         "CNN —\n\nShould the country’s most populous state be split into three separate states? California voters might be able to make that decision this fall.\n\nA local venture capitalist’s proposal to break up California, “CAL 3,” gained nearly double the necessary signatures to get it on the ballot in November, which will allow state voters to decide on the partition.\n\nTim Draper announced Thursday that his initiative had gotten more than 600,000 signatures from registered voters across all of the state’s 58 counties, surpassing the 365,880 signatures required by state law.\n\n“This is an unprecedented show of support on behalf of every corner of California to create three state governments that emphasize representation, responsiveness, reliability and regional identity,” Draper said.\n\nHow could this help California?\n\nAccording to the proposal, first announced in November, this will solve California’s most pressing issues, including the state’s failing school systems, high taxes, deteriorating infrastructure and strained government.\n\nDraper explained that partitioning California into three states would empower regional communities to make better and more sensible decisions for their citizens.\n\n“To create three states from a standing start, you’ll get all the benefits of knowing all the things that worked in the past, and all the things that could work in the future and you get to eliminate all the baggage you got in the state,” Draper said in a news conference Thursday night at Draper University.\n\n“When you get together and you start something fresh, you have a new way to look at it and create better things” he added.\n\nThe 3 smaller states\n\nDraper also suggests that California citizens would be better served by three smaller state governments while preserving the historic boundaries of the various counties, cities and towns.\n\nCalifornia: This will be considered the new state which includes Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey and San Benito counties.\n\nSouthern California: San Diego, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, Mono, Madera, Inyo, Tulare, Fresno, Kings, Kern and Imperial counties.\n\nNorthern California: This would include the Bay Area and the 31 remaining counties north of Sacramento.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nDraper says CAL 3 will deliver the 600,000 signatures to the secretary of state next week and the signatures will then have to be vetted and approved.\n\nCNN reached out to Secretary of State Alex Padilla, but he refused to comment until he receives the signatures.\n\nIf the measure is approved by voters, the governor will transfer the notice of state approval to Congress, which will\n\nvote to ratify the creation of the new three-state structure.\n\nConstitutional lawyer and professor Jonathan Turley told CNN that congressional approval is not impossible, but not likely to happen, as Democrats could feel they have too much to lose.\n\n“Dems consider California to be a single golden empire, it would be hard for them to accept it as three golden empires.”\n\nTurley explained that with the creation of two new states, this would likely add four new members to the US Senate, something that could create endless tensions between representatives.\n\nDraper backed a proposal to turn California into six states in 2014 but it failed to get the required number of signatures to qualify, and the measure was not presented to voters in the 2016 polls.",

         "NIMRUD, IRAQ—Popping open a bottle of champagne and dancing with a mummified corpse in celebration, Smithsonian Institution archeologist Dr. Kathleen Roberts confessed she was “excited as all hell” Thursday after “hitting the mass grave jackpot” in northern Iraq. “Booyah! I mean, seriously, fuck yeah—we’re rolling in bones, baby,” said Roberts, throwing handfuls of Holocene-era rib bones into the air and standing under the confetti-like cascade of osseous chips. “Rang-a-dang, suckers! This is why I got into the business. I mean, you hear about people hitting the burial site lottery like this, but you never think it’s going to happen to you. There must be a 10-foot layer of bones down there! We got warrior bones, kids’ bones, skeletons of virgins tied to stakes. It must have been an absolute bloodbath. Truly horrific. I’m gonna be stinking rich! No more trying to get excited about a body here or a possible sacrifice there. Just goes to show, you gotta keep playing to win though.” Roberts then stripped to her underwear, lustily rubbed her hands together, and dove headfirst into the staggering assemblage of scientifically significant ancient remains.",
