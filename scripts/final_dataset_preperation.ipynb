         "Voters in the party that has not lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994 are most likely to say that elections are fraught with criminality, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.\n\nThe findings echo Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s “rigged election” theme and rising apprehension over foreign or criminal hackers.\n\nRepublicans, who have won every statewide election in Texas for the past two decades, were more likely than independents and much more likely than Democrats to say that “people voting who are not eligible” will be an “extremely serious” or “somewhat serious” problem in this year’s elections.\n\nNine of 10 Republicans said ineligible voters voting would be a serious problem, 69 percent of independents said so and only 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Three-quarters of the Democrats rated the problem “not too serious” or “not serious at all.”\n\nAmong the Republican voters, 70 percent ranked the problem as “extremely serious.”\n\n“Wow,” said Daron Shaw, co-director of the poll and a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, after looking over the results. “To me, it’s an indication of how unhappy people are with the system, how deeply they believe it is corrupt and incompetent.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe same pattern held true when they were asked about people voting multiple times. Overwhelming numbers of Republican likely voters — 83 percent — said that will be a serious problem this year. Among independent voters, 61 percent agreed with that, but only 24 percent of Democrats think multiple voting will be a serious problem.\n\n“This is one of these showcase results where you have to ask the chicken-and-egg question about Republican attitudes in Texas and what Donald Trump seems to have wrought — but might just be plugging into,” said Jim Henson, who heads the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin and co-directs the poll. “Republicans nationally, but also in Texas, have been stoking worries about the election process in the absence of any systematic evidence of any real problems.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe party lines blur a bit when voters are asked about “votes being counted inaccurately.” Three quarters of self-identified Republican and independent voters think that will be a serious concern this year, and 45 percent of Democrats agree with them.\n\nAnd the lines fade more when it comes to “voting machines being hacked into by a foreign government or other bad actor.” That one got a serious ranking from 66 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of independents and 55 percent of Democrats.\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 14 to Oct. 23 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points. Among likely voters — those who said either that they are certain to vote or that they have voted in “every” recent election — the margin of error is +/- 3.16 percentage points (n=959). Numbers in charts might not add up to 100 percent because of rounding.\n\nThis is one of several stories on the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. Yesterday: The race for president. Also today: What Texas voters think about various state and federal officeholders and institutions.\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.

         "Phil Murphy beats Kim Guadagno to succeed Christie as N.J. governor",
         "TRENTON -- Phil Murphy, a former Wall Street executive and diplomat with no previous elected experience but deep pockets and strong ties to the Democratic Party, easily defeated Republican Kim Guadagno Tuesday to succeed Chris Christie as New Jersey's governor.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, with 99 percent of districts reporting, Murphy led Guadagno by about 13 percentage points -- 55.4 percent to 42.5 percent, according to the Associated Press. Murphy was ahead by nearly 250,000 voters -- 1.12 million to 859,000.\n\nCNN, ABC, and NBC projected Murphy the victory around 8 p.m. Tuesday, almost immediately after the polls closed. The projection was based on exit polling and was an indicator the race would not be close.\n\nMurphy's victory over Guadagno, Christie's lieutenant governor, will usher in a new era of Democratic rule in the Garden State after eight years of Christie, a once-popular Republican who saw his approval rating plummet to historic lows in recent years. Christie was prohibited by state law from running for a third consecutive term.\n\nMurphy, 60, will become the first Democrat in the governor's office since Jon Corzine, another former Goldman Sachs executive who spent millions of his own money to win the seat in 2005 but lost re-election to Christie in 2009.\n\nWhen Murphy is sworn in as the state's 56th governor Jan. 16, Democrats will likely control both the governor's office and the state Legislature for the first time since Corzine's four-year term.\n\nAll legislative races have not been called yet, but Democrats will at least hold -- if not expand -- their control of both the state Senate and Assembly.\n\n\"Tonight, we declare the days of division over,\" Murphy said during his victory speech in Asbury Park. \"We will move forward together. ... We have each other's backs.\"\n\nMurphy -- a former U.S. ambassador to Germany -- will take over arguably the most powerful governor's seat in the nation, with the ability to line-item veto bills and the state budget and appoint state officials who are elected in other states.\n\nHe has promised to push New Jersey in a progressive direction, vowing to legalize and tax marijuana, institute a $15 minimum wage, tighten the state's already strict gun-control laws, and ramp up funding for education, public-worker pensions, and transportation, while protecting undocumented immigrants and fighting the agenda of President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nMurphy said Tuesday night that he will push back against \"the mean winds\" blowing out of Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This is one of the first major elections since Donald Trump was elected,\" he said. \"Tonight, New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation: We are better than this.\"\n\nMurphy will also bring a much different personality to the governor's office than Christie did. Whereas Christie made national headlines for his brash, often combative attitude, Murphy is more low-key and prone to smiling even when challenged.\n\nMurphy inherits a state with signifiant problems -- including the highest property taxes in the country, a troubled transportation system, and a public-worker pension system deeply in debt.\n\nFor Guadagno, the loss brings an end to her eight-year run in Trenton. With her association to Christie hanging on her like an albatross, Guadagno trailed Murphy by double digits in every poll and had a 3-to-1 fundraising disadvantage in a state where registered Democrats outnumber register Republicans by about 880,000.\n\nGuadagno, who was vying to become only the second woman governor in state history, lost even though she had cut into Murphy's lead in polls with an aggressive push before Election Day.\n\nGuadagno said during her concession speech that her campaign \"made the best case possible.\"\n\n\"We were fighting for our families and we will continue that fight for lower taxes and a safer New Jersey,\" she told the crowd in Aberdeen. \"This is not the end. ... We may have lost the battle, but we will win this war in the long run.\"\n\nNew Jersey was one of only two states in the U.S. with a governor's election Tuesday, along with Virginia.\n\nAnd though voters in the blue state were getting to choose Christie's replacement a year after Trump's election, the race largely inspired apathy among Jerseyans. Up until last week, polls showed more than half of likely voters knew little about Guadagno or Murphy.\n\nBut a Democrat -- Ralph Northam -- also won Virginia's race. And political experts Tuesday were already framing both elections as a repudiation of Trump's policies.\n\nTuesday's victory caps an unexpected journey to the Statehouse for Murphy, a Boston area native who was little known in the state before entering this race last year.\n\nMurphy gobbled up support from the Democratic Party chairs in key north Jersey counties to become the front-runner for the party's nomination, pushing aside expected candidates like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester.\n\nHe then spent $16 million of his own fortune en route to handily beating five primary opponents to snag the Democratic nomination.\n\nMurphy repeatedly linked Guadagno to Christie and promised to boost the state's economy, saying his time at Goldman Sachs taught him how to create jobs.\n\nGuadagno repeatedly linked Murphy to Corzine, calling him an out-of-touch multimillionaire liberal who would raise taxes in the state.\n\nMurphy plans to increase spending by $1.3 billion on education, pensions, and transportation by hiking taxes on wealthy residents, closing corporate tax loopholes, and taxing legal pot. He says the hikes would spare the middle class.\n\nHe also proposes instituting a state-run bank to help rev the economy.\n\nMurphy vows to battle Trump's policies in a diverse state where the president is deeply unpopular. He said during a debate that he would even consider making New Jersey a \"sanctuary state\" to protect some undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nGuadagno pounced on that, painting Murphy as being too soft on crime and releasing a controversial television ad that suggested he would even protect \"deranged murderers\" like Jose Carranza, an undocumented immigrant from Peru who was convicted of killing thee teens in Newark in 2007.\n\nMurphy and his supporters denounced the commercial as racist and deceitful. Visiting Edison to stump for Murphy, former Vice President Joe Biden called it \"the return of Willie Horton\" -- a reference to the infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race.\n\nPolitical experts said Guadagno appeared to be borrowing a page from Trump's far-right playbook to appeal to the GOP base in what was predicted to be a race with a record-low voter turnout.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nPolls showed that Guadagno was hurt by her connection to Christie, a one-time national Republican star and presidential contender whose approval ratings have dropped by nearly 50 percentage points over the last few years.\n\nAfter voting in Mendham on Tuesday morning, Christie rejected the idea that this race was a referendum on his two terms as governor.\n\n\"This is not an election about me,\" Christie said. \"I had my referendum. My referendum was four years ago.\"\n\nChristie said he voted for @KimGuadagnoNJ, and that he doesn't think 2017 is a referendum on his tenure pic.twitter.com/aBMOPMYVWq — Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017\n\nNew Jerseyans often pinball between electing Republicans and Democrats for governor. No Democratic governor has won re-election since Brendan Byrne did 40 years ago, in 1977.\n\nMurphy overcame his ties to Goldman Sachs, which had become a target of derision during last year's presidential race. He spent 23 years at the Wall Street firm, managing its Asian and German offices.\n\nHe and his wife, Tammy Murphy, donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party both locally and national over the years and he served as the finance chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2006 to 2009.\n\nPresident Barack Obama then chose Murphy to become America's ambassador to Germany, a post Murphy held until 2013.\n\nMurphy was bolstered over the last two months by campaign visits from a string of big-name Democrats -- including Obama, Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Al Gore. Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi, his friend and neighbor, also performed at a Murphy rally two days before Election Day.\n\nMurphy also had the support of dozens of labor unions, including the New Jersey Education Association and the Communication Workers of America.\n\nMurphy's lieutenant governor will be Sheila Oliver, a veteran member of the state Assembly from Essex County who was the first black woman to serve as Assembly speaker in state history.\n\nOliver also won re-election to her Assembly seat on Tuesday. But under state law, she will have to give up that post to serve as lieutenant governor.\n\nNJ Advance Media staff writers Matt Arco and Claude Brodesser-Akner contributed to this report.\n\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.

         "Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks\n\nAlthough the past few years have been an incredibly powerful time for women’s rights, feminism has just suffered a pretty crushing setback: Tragically, this woman sucks.\n\nDevastating. This is not good news for the feminist cause.\n\nThe notion that all women are powerful queens who deserve the world sadly doesn’t even come close to applying to 28-year-old Sarah Baylor, whose boring hobbies, grating personality traits, and overall lack of positive attributes prove that some women can (and do) absolutely suck. Between the below-average work she does at her totally inconsequential job, the meandering anecdotes about owning a ferret she foists on unsuspecting acquaintances, and the fact that she honestly smells kind of bad, Sarah unfortunately does not bring a single thing to the table that would compel someone to fight for women’s rights on her behalf. It’s tough to imagine anyone getting behind a movement intended to empower someone as unpleasant to be around as this god-awful woman.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s difficult to extend any sisterly support to someone who sucks this much ass.\n\nThere’s no telling how far Sarah will set back the feminist cause over the course of her life, but her apparent commitment to using her bad personality to totally blow every personal and professional opportunity that comes her way suggests that she will continue giving women a bad name for the foreseeable future. Had Sojourner Truth known that one day a woman like Sarah would go through life without ever doing anything even marginally impressive—seriously, not even winning some kind of bogus “citizenship” award in elementary school—would she have bothered to fight for women’s rights in the first place? It’s hard to say.\n\nYikes. We can only imagine what kind of damage Sarah already done to feminism just by being her selfish, slovenly, and frankly horrible self. Here’s hoping the feminist agenda finds a way to prevail despite such an awful blight on the movement.",

         "In the last 24 hours, four federal courts have objected to Trump’s actions",
         "Last night, a Federal District court issued an emergency stay on deportations for passengers affected by President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. Since that first decision, three other courts have issued their own rulings, putting a halt to deportations for those detained at airports across the country.\n\nDespite the rulings, there appears to be some uncertainty surrounding the judicial orders. The New York Post reports that some customs agents have ignored the orders, and have not allowed access to detainees. We’ll update this report as more information becomes available.\n\nTrump’s team now appears to be tweaking the executive order in response to widespread protests. Late on Sunday night, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a waiver that allows people holding green cards or with valid permanent residence in the United States to enter the country. In a statement published on the DHS’ site, Kelly said that “in applying the provisions of the president’s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.” The statement says that “absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”\n\nHere’s where we stand:\n\nNew York City\n\nFederal Judge Ann Donnelly noted in her decision that that “there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject,” impacted by the order. The order was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a pair of Iraqi refugees who had been detained.\n\nThe order only applies to individuals who had been detained at airports around the country: that is, people who had come from one of the nations that were banned in the executive order.\n\nThe decision has no impact on the rest of the order, which bans citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya from entering the United States for the next 90 days, bans refugees from those countries for 120 days, and bans refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nAlexandria, Virginia\n\nFederal Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a ruling last night as well for 50 to 60 individuals from the affected countries who are Lawful Permanent Residents. According to petitioners, the people detained were denied access to lawyers, and that removing them from the country would result in “irreparable harm.”\n\nBrinkema agreed, ordering that the detained individuals be granted access to legal counsel, and forbid them from being deported for the next seven days.\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nIn Seattle, members of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed for an Emergency Stay of Removal on behalf of two individuals, saying that the detentions were illegal. District Court Judge Thomas Thomas S. Zilly ordered the stay of removal, “pending further order of the court.” He also set a hearing for Friday, February 3rd to determine whether or not to lift the stay.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nFinally, petitioners filed a petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive relief with the federal court overnight in Boston, Massachusetts. US District Judge Allison D. Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Gail Dein found that the detention and removal of “the petitioners and others similarly situated would violate their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection as guaranteed by the United States Constitution,” and that should the detained individuals be removed from the US, they would likely “suffer irreparable harm.”\n\nThe judges ordered that the Department of Homeland Security would be required to limit “secondary screening to comply with the regulations and statutes in effect prior to the Executive Order,” were not permitted to “detain or remove” approved refugees, anyone who held a valid Visa, green card holders, and other individuals “who, absent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.” The ruling stipulated that the United States Marshall of Massachusetts would be served with the order and required to enforce it, and that Border Patrol and Customs should notify airlines arriving at Boston’s Logan Airport of the order and that individuals on the flights would not be detained or deported. The judges noted that this ruling would remain in effect for seven days, with another hearing scheduled before then.\n\nThe four rulings represent a setback for the Trump administration, which was acting on campaign promises to halt the flow of refugees and immigrants to the United States, and were accompanied by widespread protests last night, with more planned in the coming days.\n\nFollowing the rulings, the American Civil Liberties Union has promised to continue to fight against the executive orders. “This is merely the first skirmish in a long battle to vigorously defend the Bill of Rights from the authoritarian designs of the Trump administration.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement this morning that it would “comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump’s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.”\n\nThis morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that the country needed extreme vetting, and pointed to immigration in Europe. He also defended his administration decision to provide preferential treatment to minority Christians attempting to enter the United States, noting that they were “executed in large numbers.”\n\nThis morning, The New York Times reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said that green card holders will be permitted to enter the country, but that they would have “discretionary authority” to detain and question individuals.\n\nUpdated to add information from The New York Times and details of John Kelly’s statement.\n\nTrump’s ‘Muslim ban’ won’t help security",

         "Health officials find first cases of new superbug in US",
         "Just five months after federal health officials asked hospitals and physicians to be on the lookout for an often-fatal, antibiotic-resistant fungus called Candida auris, 13 cases have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. It is the first time that the fungus, which is easily misidentified in lab tests as a more common candida yeast infection, has been found in the US, and four of the first seven patients with it have died.\n\n“We need to act now to better understand, contain and stop the spread of this drug-resistant fungus,” the CDC’s director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said in a statement. “This is an emerging threat, and we need to protect vulnerable patients and others.”\n\nC. auris’s emergence and apparent global spread — it was first identified in Japan in 2009 and since then has been found in a dozen countries on four continents — put the pathogen on the ever-growing list of superbugs, disease-causing microbes that are resistant to many and, in some cases, all antibiotics.\n\nRead more: Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nMore From Stat News Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nThe first seven cases, which are described in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, occurred in New York, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey in 2013 (one case), 2015 (one case), and this year (five cases). The older cases were identified through a review of patients’ lab records conducted after the CDC sent its clinical alert in June. All seven of the patients had been hospitalized for cancer, respiratory failure, or other serious condition, so it is not clear if C. auris contributed to the deaths of four of them, the CDC said.\n\nThe other six cases came to the CDC’s attention after August.\n\nFive of the first seven cases had not been flagged as C. auris at the time the patients were hospitalized, underlining the difficulty of identifying the fungus. Five were also resistant to the common antifungal drug fluconazole (sold as Diflucan). One was resistant to amphotericin B, an antifungal usually saved for serious infections, and one to echinocandins, a newer class of antifungals touted as being effective against Candida.\n\nAlthough C. auris strains from other countries have been found to be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs, none of the US cases was.\n\nThe global spread of C. auris has had public health officials on alert for imported cases, but all of the US cases seem to have been contracted domestically. When scientists sequenced the genomes of C. auris in the first seven cases, they found that they were related to strains from South Asia and South America. Since none of the patients had traveled to those areas or were known to have been in contact with anyone from there, CDC scientists concluded that they had acquired the infections locally.\n\n“It appears that C. auris arrived in the United States only in the past few years,” Dr. Tom Chiller, who leads CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch, said in a statement. “We’re working hard with partners to better understand this fungus and how it spreads.”\n\nA partial answer: easily. After one of the Illinois patients was hospitalized for an unrelated illness, researchers found C. auris in his mattress, bedside table, bed rail, chair, and windowsill.\n\nMore evidence of how easy C. auris is spread, at least in hospitals: The genome sequencing showed that the two patients treated in the same New Jersey hospital at the same time had nearly identical strains; the genome sequences of the C. auris infecting the two Illinois patients, also treated at the same hospital at the same time, were also nearly identical to one another. “These findings suggest that C. auris could be spread in healthcare settings,” the CDC said.\n\nAlthough 60 percent of people with C. auris infections outside the US have died, the CDC said, that figure is based on a small number of patients, many of whom had other severe illnesses, making it unclear how serious the infection on its own might be.",

         "Resistance Win: When One Of Her Students Wore A MAGA Hat To Class, This Incredible Teacher Stopped Having Sex With Him After School\n\nFair warning to all you Drumpf lovers out there: You might want to keep scrolling past this story, because a Resistance smackdown this epic may be too much for you to handle: A student in this Toledo, OH high school wore a MAGA hat to class, and his incredible teacher’s amazing response was to completely stop having sex with him every day after school.\n\nAbsolutely perfect. Now THIS is how you secure a W for the right side of history!\n\nAs soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls. Yep, this teacher is the kind of heroic lover of freedom who simply refuses to have an affair with any student of hers who supports Trump’s despicable administration.\n\nHow’s that burn feel, Drumpf lovers??\n\nSo. Epic. It’s not always easy to take a stand in a world where bigotry of all kinds has become the norm since Treasonous Trump took the reins, so it’s absolutely thrilling when someone like Amanda Higgins claps back by telling her Trump-supporting student that she’ll no longer be having sex with him in her car after he’s done with wrestling practice. That 15-year-old MAGA shithead just found out the hard way that actions have consequences.\n\nMs. Higgins, we salute you! The Resistance believes that you deserve to be having sex with a student who believes in freedom and equality for all—not a hateful and bigoted Trump supporter like Eric. Let this be a warning shot to all you Dump lovers out there: If you support this corrupt administration, your days are as numbered as the president’s, because there are plenty more badass takedowns like this on the horizon!",

         "NEW YORK—In a move touted as a major victory for the rights of New Yorker public transportation passengers who are this close to fucking losing it, the Metropolitan Transit Authority unveiled a new designated seating system Friday designed to accommodate commuters who seem to be just about to snap. “For too many years, the New York City MTA has failed to meet the needs of scowling riders repeatedly muttering ‘Fuck this shit’ under their breath, but today, we’re excited to announce that individuals about to blow a fuse will now be offered seats where they can have a second of goddamn peace,” said spokesman Aaron Donovan, adding that the initiative would cater to the roughly 1.7 million city residents who find themselves on the brink of daily violent meltdowns by adding a minimum of four seating options by the entrance of each subway car, rail car, and bus. “Those seats reserved for customers one bad moment away from flipping their wig at any second will have signage indicating them as such. Those who are clearly going through some serious shit and wearing an expression conveying ‘Not today’ have long been overlooked, so, as always, offer your seat to the critically cranked-up when at all possible.” Shortly after their introduction, thousands of transit passengers across New York City were seen going totally fucking apeshit upon discovering the priority seats already occupied.",

         "One Video Game Company Has Murky Ties To Trump’s Lawyer And Russian Payments",
         "Photo: Alexey Filippov (Host Photo Agency via Getty Images)\n\nRobert Mueller’s investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken all sorts of strange turns over the past year and a half, but this might be one of the strangest: It turns out that Trump’s lawyer has a circuitous connection to the video game company behind games like H1Z1 and Everquest.\n\n\n\nLast night, word came out that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, had received $500,000 in payments from a U.S. investment firm connected to a Russian oligarch named Viktor Vekselberg. That firm, Columbus Nova, has its fingers in a lot of pots. In January 2016, months before a wrestler’s lawsuit led to Kotaku’s former parent company Gawker Media getting purchased by Univision, Columbus Nova put a minority investment into Gawker. And in 2015, it was reported that Columbus Nova purchased Sony Online Entertainment, the San Diego, CA-based studio behind dozens of well-received video games. We knew that because both companies announced it together, with a press release declaring, “Columbus Nova acquires Sony Online Entertainment.” Alongside the move, the company said it would be changing its name to Daybreak.\n\n\n\nNow, Daybreak is rewriting history. Over the past few weeks, as the studio laid off staff amidst a declining audience for H1Z1, Daybreak has distanced itself from Columbus Nova, deleting said press release from its website and telling reporters that it had not actually been purchased by the investment firm, but in fact by businessman Jason Epstein. “Daybreak Game Company has no affiliation with Columbus Nova,” the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement on April 25. “Jason Epstein purchased Daybreak (then SOE) from Sony in February 2015. Mr. Epstein was a senior partner at Columbus Nova at the time he acquired the company. He left Columbus Nova in 2017 and remains the primary shareholder of Daybreak.”\n\nThat statement contradicts much of the company’s past three years, however. Daybreak described Columbus Nova as its parent company in its 2015 user privacy policy, as well as in a press release by Fenwick and West, the law firm that represented SOE in the acquisition. A spokesperson for Daybreak Games would not comment on how the press release could have been so misleading and why no subsequent statements that Columbus Nova owned the company were never corrected before now. Instead, Daybreak elaborated on its initial statement in a forum post, saying it was well aware of past statements made about the company’s ownership but that Epstein had been the majority owner since the acquisition. Daybreak’s spokespeople added that recent changes to the company’s website and third-party communications were simply part of a new effort to set the record straight.\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Daybreakgames.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuestions over Daybreak’s relationship to Columbus Nova began to bubble up in April, when the website MassivelyOP pointed out that the U.S. government had frozen some of Viktor Vekselberg’s assets, which it believed raised questions about the future of games like Everquest II. Vekselberg, a Russian businessman whose net worth in 2015 was reportedly $13.5 billion, is the owner of a company called Renova Group. Until this week, it was widely reported and believed that Columbus Nova was a subsidiary of Renova Group—something that Columbus Nova now denies. Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, has been the CEO of Columbus Nova since 2000 according to his bio on the investment firm’s website, a page which was removed sometime in the last 24 hours. And yesterday, Columbus Nova put out a statement denying that it was owned by Renova Group. “Throughout its existence, Columbus Nova has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients,” the statement reads. “Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group.”\n\n\n\nBoth Vekselberg and Intrater have donated to Trump and both attended his inauguration, according to The New York Times, which also reports that both men have since been interviewed by special prosecutor Bob Mueller’s office, the team in charge of investigating Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nSo here we are. Until April, everyone had believed that Columbus Nova owned Daybreak, which Daybreak now denies. Until this week, everyone had believed that Renova Group owned Columbus Nova—SEC filings even showed as much—which Columbus Nova now denies. And yesterday, news broke that Trump’s lawyer had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late April, as Daybreak was telling press that it was not actually owned by Columbus Nova, the game studio was also laying off staff. Laura Naviaux Sturr, chief publishing officer at Daybreak following the acquisition, left the company on April 25. A day later, many designers and programmers at Daybreak announced on Twitter that they had been let go.\n\nOne of the people laid off, an employee who had been at the company for over six years and asked not to be named, told Kotaku in an email that rumors of the layoffs had been circulating around the office for months and that some people had already cleared out their desks ahead of the official announcement. The employee, who was in a management role, said Epstein owning the company came as a surprise. “Most of us were just as confused by the statement as everyone else was,” they said. “I guess a select few people knew we weren’t actually owned by Columbus Nova, but they were definitely in the minority.”\n\nScreenshot: Daybreak Games (H1Z1)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former creative lead on Planetside 2, who also wished to remain anonymous, shared a similar story. “My understanding at the time was that we were being added to a holding company for Russian investments in tech which was run by Jason,” they told Kotaku. “There was an all-hands meeting shortly before I left where Jason introduced himself, explained who Columbus Nova and Renova were.” While their understanding was that Jason ran Columbus Nova, but was not acquiring the studio himself, they say the distinction was never really made explicit one way or the other.\n\n\n\nThat person left the company shortly after it was sold and after a large round of layoffs. Months later, studio president John Smedley, who had founded the company, left as well. (In the original press release about the sale, Smedley was attributed to the quote: “We are excited to join Columbus Nova’s impressive roster of companies.” Smedley did not respond to a request for comment.) He was replaced by Ji Ham, a vice president at Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAnd what of Columbus Nova’s ties to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and his company, Renova? Despite Columbus Nova’s denials, the web is full of bread crumbs linking the two companies. For example, while Jason Epstein’s profile on the Columbus Nova MB website no longer exists, an archived version of what appeared in September of 2016 lists him as a managing partner of Renova US Management, the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur own connections to Columbus Nova are also tied to Renova. For a period of time between January of 2016 and when Univision bought Gawker the following August, Jason Epstein was given a seat on Gawker’s board of directors. “My understanding at the time of the Columbus Nova investment in Gawker Media in January 2016 was that Columbus Nova was ultimately controlled by Viktor Vekselberg,” John Cook, who was then executive editor of Gawker Media, told me today. Columbus Nova was commonly understood to be the U.S. operating arm of the Russian conglomerate and ultimately owned by Vekselberg, something reiterated in multiple news reports at the time. At the same time, Cook said neither Vekselberg nor anyone at Columbus Nova attempted to exercise any influence over editorial matters during that time.\n\n\n\nMorale at Daybreak remains low, according to the source who was laid off from the studio two weeks ago. They told me that, based on conversations with people still at Daybreak, the atmosphere is grim, despite ongoing company-wide meetings to try and allay people’s concerns about the future of the company. As Daybreak prepares for the PS4 release of H1Z1, whose open beta will launch on May 22, its murky ties to Trump and the Russian investigation cannot be of much comfort.\n\n\n\nUpdate - 5:57pm: Updated the language in the second paragraph to clarify that while Columbus Nova’s acquisition of Daybreak was noted in a press release, it was otherwise not confirmed.",

         "Former stripper who filmed lovers seeks pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens",
         "CLAYTON • A former law student and male stripper prosecuted for invasion of privacy for secretly filming sex partners two decades ago is now seeking a pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, indicted under the same criminal statute last week.\n\nA letter sent Sunday to a lawyer for Greitens cites Greitens’ own motion to dismiss his case and his “published position on this statute,” and requests that the lawyer forward the request.\n\nThe pardon application was submitted to former Gov. Jay Nixon in 2011. He did not grant it or reject it, leaving it pending, the letter says.\n\nThe pardon request, sent by lawyer Albert Watkins, is on behalf of Paul Henreid, of Walnut Creek, Calif., who is a documentary filmmaker and lawyer.\n\nWatkins, who has never shied from publicity or controversy, said in a news release that it would be “mighty hypocritical” for Greitens to reject the request given Greitens’ dismissal motion.\n\n“What’s good for the governor should be good for the gander,” Watkins said.\n\nWatkins also represents the ex-husband of the woman with whom Greitens had an affair. Thursday’s indictment claims Greitens photographed her nude or partially nude without her consent and then transmitted that photograph in some unspecified way.\n\nThe governor’s motion to dismiss does not challenge the existence of a photo, but says the woman had no expectation of privacy, which is a requirement of the invasion of privacy statute, during a consensual sexual encounter.\n\nAudio: Woman describes encounter with Greitens A man says he recorded his then-wife describing an encounter with Eric Greitens in March 2015. The recording, obtained by the Post-Dispatch, w…\n\nIn a taped conversation with her husband, the woman said the governor took the photo without her consent during a consensual sexual encounter, then threatened to release it if she mentioned his name. Greitens has denied blackmailing the woman.\n\nThe scandal has prompted calls for Greitens’ resignation, as well as an independent investigation by legislators.\n\nHis lawyers lashed out at the indictment, and Greitens, a Republican, called it a “misguided political decision” by a “reckless liberal prosecutor” in a statement.\n\nLovers secretly filmed\n\nHenreid, then Paul Henroid, pleaded guilty to invasion of privacy in 1999 after he was caught filming multiple lovers without their knowledge.\n\nOne was a co-worker at the Metro East nightclub where Henroid “moonlighted as an exotic dancer,” the pardon application says. The filming was outed in 1997 by Henroid’s friend, who was also a rival for the woman’s affections, the application says.\n\nHenroid was indicted in 1998 on four counts: invasion of privacy, promoting child pornography, possession of child porn and child abuse. The child porn and abuse charges came because she was 17 at the time of the filming. Although she could legally consent to sex, it was illegal to film her fully or partially nude, the pardon application says.\n\nHenroid’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the invasion of privacy statute as unconstitutionally vague and, foreshadowing Greitens’ own challenge 20 years later, as aimed at “peeping Toms,” not someone engaged in consensual sex, the application says. Henroid then pleaded guilty to the invasion of privacy charge as part of a deal that resulted in the dismissal of the other charges.\n\nHe expected a type of probation that would erase the conviction from the public record, but the judge disagreed. She sentenced him to 30 days of shock time and left him with a conviction, saying he shouldn’t be allowed to be a lawyer “because you have shown no regard for that law or the rights of others,” according to a transcript of the hearing. He was ordered to spend the 30 nights in jail but was allowed out during the day to work.\n\nHenreid is considering running for public office, the application says. He admits that his actions were “deceitful and immoral,” but says the punishment he has suffered and continues to suffer “is unwarranted based on the facts of this case.”\n\nGreitens’ lawyers couldn’t be immediately reached for comment Sunday.",

         "‘When I’m Onstage Performing, There Can Be Up To A Dozen Confused Birds Flapping Around The Ceiling And I Hardly Notice Them At All’: 5 Questions With Janelle Monáe\n\nJanelle Monáe first made her mark in the music world in 2010 with her critically acclaimed debut album, The ArchAndroid, and her incredible artistry and vision have garnered six Grammy nominations since. Monáe has also brought her powerful storytelling abilities to the big screen with roles in two beloved recent films: Hidden Figures and Moonlight. We sat down with the entertainer to talk about her work as an actress, her political activism, and how she produced her most recent studio album.\n\n1. You were signed to Bad Boy Records for the bulk of your career until leaving in 2015. What was your experience with the Diddy-run label like?\n\nIt was definitely a little frustrating. Back when I signed in 2007, it felt like the label was still searching for the artist who would fill The Notorious B.I.G.’s shoes, and at times it seemed like they were hoping it’d be me. Diddy was always interrupting my recording sessions to say things like, “Please, please be mean to Tupac in the next part of this song,” or, “I’m begging you to call Tupac a bald little bitch during the chorus this time. We really need this.” It started to get in the way of my creative process when Diddy would pull me aside and say, “The way Tupac wore his bandana kind of looks like a big Christmas bow—maybe you could do something with that.” Eventually, I got tired of being at a label that couldn’t grow beyond the Biggie vs. Tupac days, so I had to leave.\n\n2. You enlisted the help of The Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson on your new album, Dirty Computer. Was it hard to get him on board?\n\nIt was difficult at first because he didn’t really seem to get what I was going for musically, but once I began breaking things down in a way that was more in his wheelhouse, he was incredible. The breakthrough happened when I came up with a few simple analogies and instructions that he could understand, like “Imagine the microphone is a surfboard and I’m the blonde babe who’s surfing on it in one of those old-ass striped one-piece bathing suits,” or, “I want the production of this song to sound nothing like what you imagine seaweed to sound like underwater,” or, “Sing these lyrics, but mention being buried in sand as little as possible while you do it.” Those analogies did wonders in getting us on the same page. The guy is a legend, and I was happy we could find a way to work together.\n\n3. For you, what’s the main difference between performing as a singer and performing as an actor?\n\nWhen I’m acting, if two birds somehow find their way indoors and fly right in front of the camera it can be enough to completely ruin an entire take. But when I’m performing to a capacity crowd in a huge music venue, there can be up to a dozen confused birds flapping around the ceiling and I hardly notice them at all.\n\n4. You’ve been known to wear tuxedos both onstage and off. How did you develop that personal uniform?\n\nI think tuxedos are the ideal clothing item because they’re so versatile. In a full tuxedo, you’re equally at home at a fancy gala or a drunken beach party, a black-tie wedding or a backyard mud-wrestling tournament, a champagne cruise or a race through the woods to find the EpiPen that a squirrel stole from your cousin. I feel like I can go anywhere in a tuxedo, and that’s why I love wearing one.\n\n5. You’ve been an outspoken political activist in recent years, leading Black Lives Matter marches and working to secure aid for people affected by the Flint, Michigan water crisis. What drives you to be politically engaged?\n\nIt’s simple. I know that if I don’t do something about the problems in our society, someone else will have to—and I’m worried that it would end up being someone weird, like that guy from the Guinness Book Of World Records with the beard of bees. I don’t want to see the bees guy become an activist, so I step up.",

         "Get The Tissues Ready: The Next Song On This Emo Album Is Just A Guy’s First Name So You Know It’s Going To Be About The Lead Singer’s Friend Who Died When They Were In High School\n\nIf you’re not in the mood for a good cry, you’re gonna want to stop here, because the waterworks are about to be turned all the way up: The next song on this emo album is just a guy’s first name, so you know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s friend who died when they were in high school.\n\nYup, it’s pretty clear. There’s basically only one way this next song could go, and it’s going to be an absolute downer.\n\nEverything’s pretty much been par for the course as the second song on this emo album winds down. The first two songs were titled “I Feel January In My Bones” and “These Hands For The Trembling,” and covered standard emo fare like the vague sadness of realizing that the people you once looked up to don’t have all the answers and how all of the lead singer’s high school friends used to have big dreams but ended up getting stuck in their hometown. But things are definitely about to get much more bleak because the third track on the album is just called “Mikey,” so you just fucking know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s best friend from high school who couldn’t overcome his debilitating opioid addiction and overdosed or died in a car accident or some depressing shit like that.\n\nWhile it was easy to tell that this album was going to be at least a little sad by the looks of the cover art, which just shows an upperish-middle-class suburban house in the wintertime and has the band’s name stamped in a simple cursive font on the bottom right corner, it’s pretty clear that once “Mikey” starts, the vibe of the album is about to go from general angsty-sad to full-blown-crying sad.\n\nSeriously, you should definitely turn the album off before it gets to “Mikey” unless you want to listen to the lead singer blame himself for his friend’s early death with lines like, “I should’ve been there when you needed me most//and now I waltz with the cold of your ghost,” or, “Your eyes were too hazy to see the tears in mine//and now yours are shut forever.” Point blank, this is going to be a massive bummer.\n\nFinal warning, because the current song is wrapping up now, so if you don’t bail now, you’re about to get emotionally wrecked by “Mikey.” It’s almost definitely going to start off quietly and slowly build up until the lead singer is full-blown screaming metaphors that describe his friend as a short but intense mid-summer storm casting brief shadows across forgotten power lines, and it’s probably going to leave you feeling melancholy for the rest of the day. But if you have your tissues handy and are ready to hear the lead singer and the drummer sing intertwining vocals about how the friend’s funeral scarred the lead singer so badly that he can’t even walk past the church it was held in anymore or something along those lines, then strap the fuck in and let the tears roll. Good luck!",

         "Nothing could have prepared the men and women from the Colorado Springs Fire Department received THIS SOS call.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the scene, they started pulling out a litter of 8 puppies who were trapped in a sewer. A few hours later they realized they couldn’t have been more wrong about them.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what happened when the firemen realized they weren’t puppies they were bringing to safety.\n\nMulti-Faceted\n\nFirefighters are informed that they will regularly be called out to jobs that have nothing to do with fighting fires!\n\nMany people also make the mistake of assuming that firefighters only help people. In actuality, these hard-working men and women assist anyone.\n\nOne team of firefighters was about to help something unexpected.\n\nAnother Day\n\nFor the team of firefighters at the Colorado Springs Fire Department, it was another day at the station.\n\nToday was going to require that the team take part in a rescue. The outcome wasn’t going to be anything like they’d imagined.\n\nWhat would this day bring?\n\nThe Call\n\nThe Colorado Springs Fire Department got a phone call one day. It was a distress call to help some animals.\n\nWithin a few minutes, they were answering the call. The faster they got there, the faster they could assist the animals.\n\nThis was going to be a very unique rescue.\n\nProtocol\n\nIn any situation that includes animals, firefighters have to take specific precautions.\n\nRegardless of what it was, every animal had its own unexpected mannerisms and behaviors. This was especially true when an animal was in danger and could feel threatened.\n\nBetter to be safe than sorry.\n\nReady for Anything\n\nWith this in mind, the firefighters needed to proceed carefully. In every situation, it was important that the firefighters maintain their own safety.\n\nThis team had no idea what type of animal they were about to save, so they had to be cautious.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to hear the rescue unfold!\n\nExperience\n\nLuckily, the firefighters weren’t too worried about this particular job. In fact, the team had lots of experience.\n\nEven though they weren’t sure what kind of animal was in trouble, it was safe to say that they would be able to handle it.\n\nThis time things would be different! Click ‘Next’!\n\nAssessing the Situation\n\nThey got into their truck and raced to the location where the distressed animals appeared to be.\n\nThe animals were trapped deep beneath a storm grate. If the weather changed and it filled with water, the animals would be in trouble.\n\nWhat was waiting inside? You’ll never guess!\n\nTick Tock\n\nWithout rainy weather, the animals were fairly safe in the enclosure.\n\nThe firefighters knew that time was of the essence. Not only was the enclosure dark and deep, but it was also cold! There was no time to waste.\n\nWhat was the game plan? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Plan\n\nThe firefighters came to the conclusion that the creatures were likely fairly small. The sewer grate wasn’t very deep, and yet the animals still couldn’t get out.\n\nOnly one or two men would be needed to pull the animals out. Everyone prepped themselves.\n\nYou won’t guess what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Glance\n\nThe firefighters worked together to raise the storm grate away and expose the area beneath. They could hear the small cries of animals below.\n\nThey were quick to realize that this little group of creatures were babies. What were they doing there?\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Unfit Home\n\nThis was a very odd place for small animals to be. Animals are much better off being in the wild.\n\nThese animals were far away from any wild habitat, and weren’t going to get what they needed in this sewer grate.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbandoned Babies?\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t be sure what kind of animals were trapped in the storm drain. They took time to canvas the area.\n\nIt was likely that if there was a mom or dad around, the firefighters would have spooked them away.\n\nWhat would the firefighters do? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bad Situation\n\nWhen they saw the babies, they couldn’t believe that they were still alive. The sewer was filled with dirt and garbage.\n\nThe animals must have been freezing cold, and there was clearly no food in sight to be eaten.\n\nWould the poor babies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitive Situation\n\nThe firefighters had to approach carefully. If the mother was nearby, then perhaps she would be the one to save them.\n\nBut, if the firefighters did handle the babies, the mother may return later and decide to abandon them.\n\nTime was running out. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nTense Moments\n\nThe team of rescuers weren’t sure what kind of animals these were, which made it hard to know if the mother might be around.\n\nThere was no way of knowing what was best, but it looked like these critters needed assistance.\n\nWhat would they do!? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Decision\n\nThe firefighters had a decision to make. Should they leave the babies there, or wait for the mother to return?\n\nThey knew the babies couldn’t get out themselves. It was time to find out what animal they were dealing with.\n\nWe can’t make this up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating\n\nThe firefighters would have to investigate, by pulling out the animals and identifying exactly what they were.\n\nIf they were domestic, it was likely that these animals needed some serious help. Other wild animals might not be so desperate.\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rescue Begins\n\nThe team made sure to wear gloves, so as to avoid getting their natural smell onto the babies.\n\nA sheet was laid out beside the sewer, so that they could easily place the animals down safely once they were rescued.\n\nWe can’t make this up! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First\n\nThe firefighter slowly reached down into the sewer and gently pulled up the first baby.\n\nAt first glance, the team was in shock at the small furry animal. It was actually very cute and rolled around on the sheet innocently.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what the firefighters found!\n\n\n\n\n\nMan’s Best Friend\n\nAfter getting a good look at the first baby, the team knew what they were dealing with: Puppies!\n\nThey had no idea how the animals had gotten there, but now they knew for sure that they shouldn’t be there.\n\nWhat happens next will shock you! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sad State\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe it. The team worried that the puppies were put there by someone.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn’t uncommon for pet owners to abandon their pets. Sometimes they assume the only option is to dispose of them when desperate.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nHard Truths\n\nThe team hoped that abandonment wasn’t the case in this situation. That would have been so heartbreaking for the poor puppies\n\nWith this potential circumstance in mind, the firefighters pressed on even faster to try and help the puppies.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out why the firefighters were so angry!\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Solution\n\nFor those pet owners who aren’t able to take care of their animals, the firefighters knew that this could be a good lesson for everyone.\n\nIt is never okay to abandon animals in unfit environments. The team hoped this wasn’t the true case.\n\nThe rescue was going forward! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Litter\n\nThere was no telling how many were inside the sewer grate at first, so the team had to wait until all of them were out.\n\nLuckily, the sewer wasn’t too deep, so it was easy for the firefighters to get them all.\n\nWhat would the team do next? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Huddle\n\nThe puppies were surely very confused. One moment they were in a sewer and the next, surrounded by humans.\n\nThe poor puppies huddled together for warmth. It was clear that they had been like this for a few days.\n\nWhat happened to these little guys? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering Clues\n\nThe team was still confused as to how this situation had even begun. They spoke first with the witness who reported it.\n\nShe explained that she spotted the puppies being swept along a fast-moving stream and into the storm drain.\n\nThis lady was a regular day hero. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sigh of Relief\n\nThe lady recalled what had happened. They were glad that they hadn’t been physically put into the sewer by someone.\n\nThis changed the situation drastically. Somehow the puppies had gotten too close to the storm drain and been swept inside.\n\nThe puppies mysterious story continued. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Moves\n\nWhen the lady saw the puppies being swept away, she tried to act quickly. She tried to catch up with the puppies in time, but it was too late.\n\nShe tried to open the grate, but she didn’t have the tools.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what she did!\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling in for Help\n\nWhen the woman realized that she couldn’t help the animals herself, she decided to make the call for help.\n\nLuckily, the firefighters knew what to do, and they had the tools that were needed. They were grateful that she had called.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out something amazing about the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Great Example\n\nThe firefighters were glad to hear the actual story of the puppies. One civilian had noticed something in danger and made sure that she took action.\n\nThey hoped that everyone would do the same if they ever encountered such a situation.\n\nThe firefighters investigate. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Guesses\n\nThe the firefighters started trying to guess what kind of breed they were. All of the puppies were black with short, wiry hair.\n\nThey decided that the puppies must be Labrador puppies. It seemed like this was the best guess.\n\nThe team was going to be in for a surprise. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that all of the puppies were safe, it was time to make sure that they were all healthy.\n\nWith that, the team took the puppies to a Humane Society, in order to make sure that the animals were okay.\n\nWould the puppies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Good Shape\n\nThe firefighters were happy to hear that all of the puppies were in relatively good health. None of them seemed to be malnourished, and they were very strong.\n\nWith that, the firefighters decided that their job was complete.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’ to see what happens to the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Call\n\nMark Jenkins was one of the firefighters who was a part of the rescue. After the pups were dropped off, he left his phone number for updates.\n\nHe didn’t expect to hear about them so soon, but he got a call right after.\n\nWere the puppies okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting News\n\nThe vet was quick to assure Mark that the animals were fine, and that they did a good deed of sending them over to the vet.\n\nIt was a surprising piece of information that almost made Mark laugh out loud.\n\nWhat was the amazing surprise? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Surprise\n\nWhat the vet had to tell Mark was that the puppies had a little surprise for him.\n\nIn fact, the puppies …weren’t even dogs at all! Mark couldn’t believe his ears. They weren’t even dogs? How was this possible?\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nShocking News\n\nThe vet explained that the animals were dogs at all, but actually foxes! And they were red foxes to be exact.\n\nThe vet explained that puppies and fox cubs do have some similarities at birth, particularly because red foxes often aren’t red.\n\nThis was shocking! Click ‘Next’ to find out how it all happened!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Deed\n\nMark shared the news with the rest of his team, and they couldn’t believe the news either. Everyone had been so sure that they were puppies.\n\nRegardless of the new developments, the team was happy that they could help. It was a good day!\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe what they had to do next! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing Back\n\nEven though the baby foxes had now been saved, their story was not even close to being over!\n\nThe vet explained that the mother might still be in the area. If they could put the babies back in time, she might find them.\n\nWould the plan work? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth a Shot\n\nThey felt like they were going back a bit, but the firefighters knew that taking the foxes back was the only way. Reluctantly, the small animals went back into their sewer drain.\n\nOf course, the babies were watched closely during this time.\n\nTime would tell if the mother would return. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience\n\nOnce all of the foxes were returned to their sewer, the team waited patiently. It was important that they keep a safe distance away.\n\nIt was possible that she wouldn’t return until night. It was a waiting game for everyone.\n\nYou won’t believe what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Practices\n\nThe red fox is a very cunning animal. Most red foxes stay inside their den during the day, and move about during the night.\n\nUnfortunately, there were no signs of the mother overnight; they hoped she’s return in the morning.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Show\n\nUnfortunately, after a lot of waiting, there was no sign of the mother fox. The babies could be heard inside the sewer calling for her.\n\nShe may have been spooked by all of the action that happened earlier in the day.\n\nWhat would they do now? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving In\n\nAfter a lot of waiting, everyone’s patience seemed to wear out. It was assumed that the mother wasn’t going to be coming back after a few nights.\n\nWith time, it was decided that it was time to intervene again. The baby foxes needed assistance.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out where the foxes ended up!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nWhen the decision was made, it was time to make moves. The animals were once again gathered from the sewer and brought to the Animal Clinic of Woodland Park.\n\nThe clinic was going to be a huge help for these foxes.\n\nYou don’t want to miss this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Lessons\n\nThe clinic offers help and rehabilitation to animals of all shapes and sizes.\n\nFor other animals, like the baby foxes, the team at the clinic help to raise the babies until they are old enough to take care of themselves in the wild.\n\nThe foxes were in good hands, but the story wasn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming Educated\n\nThe story of the foxes was a funny one, but it was also an educational one. The team of firefighters learned a lot about them during this rescue.\n\nThere is so much to know about wild animals and how to deal with them.\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Very Surprising\n\nFinding the baby foxes was a huge surprise for the firefighters, but it wasn’t a huge surprise to animal experts.\n\nIt was likely that the mother fox has mated just months earlier and had given birth to them.\n\nThis wasn’t the only thing that made sense. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Spot\n\nAnimal experts also weren’t surprised by the find, since the cubs were found in Colorado. This state is well-known for its fox population.\n\nColorado has all kinds of perfect terrain for foxes, including mountains, hills, and lots of perfect places for dens.\n\nThis part is shocking. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Acceptable Place\n\nIt seemed unheard of that the mother fox would put her babies in a sewer grate. However, animal experts also understood why she might have done this.\n\nIn their natural habitat, their dens are commonly dark, cool spaces.\n\nThis mother fox made a mistake. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nHonest Mistake\n\nThe mother fox who left these cubs behind may have made a bit of a mistake when she was picking her den.\n\nThe sewer was dark and cool, and had similar characteristics to a common den in the fox’s natural habitat.\n\nThis story gets even crazier. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Birth\n\nThe story of the fox cubs was slowly coming together. Although no one could guess how the babies got there at first.\n\nThe most likely answer, was that the mother fox had actually given birth to her babies inside the sewer!\n\nWould the foxes be okay? Click ‘Next’ to learn more!\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Outlook\n\nEven though the baby foxes had been abandoned, there was still a good chance that the baby foxes were going to be okay.\n\nTo make matters even better, the baby foxes had gone through serious rehabilitation at a young age.\n\nYou won’t believe this fact. Click ‘Next’ to hear it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Occurrence\n\nThe firefighters were surprised at finding baby foxes in the busy city, but it isn’t actually an uncommon occurrence.\n\nThis is often a result of growing cities, which are starting to take over the habitat that foxes would usually roam in.\n\nWhat if a fox chooses your home? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapting\n\nThe sad thing about foxes becoming comfortable in urban areas, is that they are often seen as pests and miscreants.\n\nIt gets harder and harder for animals to find homes as habitat loss continues. People don’t understand why the foxes are nearby.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out how you can help!\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for Help\n\nThe lady who came across them did the right thing, when she decided to call for help.\n\nIt’s much better to call the appropriate help, who can handle the animals safely and assess the situation properly. Many animals should simply be left alone!\n\nWhat do you need to know?! Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Not Always Bad\n\nWhen people find baby animals that are alone, they often assume that the baby is in trouble. However, this is not always the case.\n\nSome newborn animals, such as rabbits, are alone for almost 23 hours in a day!\n\nAll in a day’s work. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Happy Ending\n\nFor these baby foxes, their ending was a happy one. One caring lady and some firefighters were able to make sure that they were well taken care of.\n\nGoing forward, the cubs will be able to grow up in their natural habitat together.\n\nThe story isn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping A Look Out\n\nWith more and more suburban growth, animals will continue to struggle for their own, personal space.\n\nIf you do happen to come across an animal that seems out of place, it’s a great idea to contact local authorities for assistance.\n\nThat Was The Last One!

         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session",
         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session\n\nThe relationship between therapist and patient can be a complicated one, and sometimes, it’s hard to tell exactly what your therapist is thinking. Here are four signs that your therapist is planning on hightailing it to Six Flags Great America right after you finish your session.\n\n1. She keeps blaming your fear of intimacy on the fact that you didn’t ride enough roller coasters as a child: If your therapist is antsy to get to Six Flags and just phoning it in until then, chances are she’s probably already got roller coasters on the brain, and that might end up coming out in your session. Sure, it’s possible that your therapist is just using roller coasters as some sort of metaphor for the ups and downs of life, but if she keeps bringing up specific rides like the Fiddler’s Fling while you’re talking through your difficulty with letting people in, it’s likely because she can’t wait to leave you mid-sentence on the couch the second your time is up and head straight to the amusement park.\n\n2. She’s insisting that the best way for you to solve your conflict with your parents is to measure her to make sure she’s taller than 54 inches, the minimum height required to ride the Raging Bull: If your therapist whips out a measuring tape while you’re on the verge of a major breakthrough about your childhood and tells you the best way to heal is to double-check that she’s over 54 inches tall, it’s a pretty good sign that she’s planning on heading to Six Flags in the very near future. Fifty-four inches isn’t that tall, so it only makes sense someone who has immediate plans to ride the Raging Bull or any of Great America’s other height-restricted rides would be so concerned with passing what would otherwise seem like a relatively arbitrary height requirement. And if she’s willing to interrupt you in the middle of your session, it’s likely because she doesn’t have long before she’s hitting the road to Six Flags.\n\n3. You overhear her muttering, “I wish therapy had a Flash Pass,” to herself: If your therapist looks distractedly out the window and imagines a world where therapy had a device that allowed her to cut right to the end of your session, it’s pretty clear her head is already in Gurnee, IL, soaking in the sights and sounds of Great America. This might be the first time she’s splurged on the real Six Flags Flash Pass, so if she’s doing the “wrap it up” motion while you’re talking about how your parents got divorced on your eighth birthday, it’s because she’s daydreaming about running from Goliath to Viper without having to wait in long lines.\n\n4. She tells you you’re cured: On its face, this is great news, but don’t allow yourself to be too caught up in the moment before you take some time to assess the situation. Do you feel cured? If the answer is no, your therapist may just be trying to rush you out of the door so she can get on the road to Six Flags before traffic sets in. If your therapist announces that you’ve finally made peace with your demons and have reached the highest level of self-actualization while she’s hurriedly applying sunscreen to her forearms and shoving a Six Flags Flash Pass into her pocket, then chances are that you still may have some work to do, and your therapist is just going to Great America.",

         "‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens",
         "SANTA FE, TX—In the hours following a violent rampage in Texas in which a lone attacker killed eight individuals and seriously injured several others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Friday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. “This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them,” said Ohio resident Erica Webb, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world’s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. “It’s a shame, but what can we do? There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”",

         "‘The Joker’ Reviewed By An Angry Mother Who Hasn’t Seen It Share:\n\nTHE HIGHLY controversial movie (according to online media) has been the source of fierce debate (according to online media) sparking calls for discussions on how movie violence encourages real life imitators (according to online media).\n\nThe Joker, released today in cinemas, illegal downloads, in the ‘synopsis’ section of Wikipedia pages and in carefully crafted online summaries designed to coax people into apoplectic rage fits is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nIn an effort to make no effort whatsoever to provide an actual expert on such matters with an important platform in a widely read publication that could see this push for faux controversy disproved and deflated we have instead asked Karen Carty (51), who is very mad at the violence and toxic messages contained in a movie she hasn’t seen, to review ‘The Joker’:\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen, a mother-of-three, began while tutting dismissively.\n\n“Suppose it’s not as bad over here when ya show violent sorts of movies, but Jesus Christ, people over in America are trying to go see this movie dressed as the Joker. It’s depraved stuff,” Karen added, alluding to some US cinemas operating a ban on people wearing Joker clothes, but allowing people to carry guns because America.\n\n“What ever happened to that hunk Cesar Romero who used to be Joker, how did the Joker come to this? I remember the worst violence in Batman was when they were climbing up the side of a building and being shouted at by apartment owners, now it’s bombs this, semi-automatic weapons that,” added Karen of the bygone era of the 1960s when murder had yet to be invented by violent video games.\n\n“I hear it’s awful violent, and it’s making kids mad for murder,” a shocked Karen explained, one hand covering her mouth to further illustrate her shock at coming to the conclusion that someone had made a movie that was so violently persuasive it could flip a switch in thousands of innocent minds and turn them into demented killers.\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen reiterated. “They shouldn’t be allowed make that sort of movie,” added Karen turning angry at the thought of a film news outlets told her would give her that warm angry feeling if she just clicked the link on their article.\n\n“Downton Abbey, now there’s a lovely movie. Why can’t people just make more of them?”",

         "TOPEKA, KS—Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible.\n\nDuring a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation’s heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group’s long-standing mission and values.\n\n“Although we’ve traditionally dedicated 97 percent of our resources to other important services such as contraception distribution, cancer screening, and STD testing, this new complex allows us to devote our full attention to what has always been our true passion: abortion,” said Richards, standing under a banner emblazoned with Planned Parenthood’s new slogan, “No Life Is Sacred.” “And since Congress voted to retain our federal funding, it’s going to be that much easier for us to maximize the number of tiny, beating hearts we stop every day.”\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/a-look-inside-planned-parenthoods-8-billion-abortionpl-1819590293\n\n“The Abortionplex’s high-tech machinery is capable of terminating one pregnancy every three seconds,” Richards added. “That’s almost a million abortions every month. We’re so thrilled!”\n\nThe 900,000-square-foot facility has more than 2,000 rooms dedicated to the abortion procedure. The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives.\n\nThe remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater—features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event.\n\n“We really want abortion to become a regular part of women’s lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions,” said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. “Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus.”\n\n“All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex,” Richards continued. “Whether she’s a high school junior who doesn’t want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can’t be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control—all are welcome.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Marcy Kolrath, one of the Abortionplex’s first clients, told reporters that despite her initial hesitancy, she was quickly put at ease by staff members who reassured her that she could have abortions over and over for the next decade before finally committing to motherhood. Kolrath also said she was “wowed” by the facility’s many attractions.\n\n“I was kind of on the fence in the beginning,” she said. “But after a couple of margaritas and a ride down the lazy river they’ve got circling the place, I got caught up in the vibe. By the time it was over, I almost wished I could’ve aborted twins and gotten to stay a little longer.”\n\n“I told my boyfriend we had to have sex again that very night,” Kolrath added. “I really want to come back over Labor Day.”",

         "Why Would Regulators Ban Kratom, An Herb For Recovering Addicts?",
         "Image Credit Wikimedia\n\nOnce Andrew Turner learned of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s plan to ban the medicinal herb he uses to manage a host of medical issues, he did what many activists do: recorded his personal testimony and put it up on YouTube.\n\nThe Navy veteran didn’t just tell his story; he could actually show what life without Kratom was like for him. Turner suffers from combat-related disabilities, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, Meige syndrome, and dystonia. He takes a small amount of powdered leaf from the Kratom plant once daily to treat his conditions.\n\nIn October, he stopped taking Kratom for six days and recorded his deteriorating condition to demonstrate “what the reality of a Kratom ban looks like.” On day five, excessive blinking, a twitching brow, and swallowing interrupted his speech. His speech was slow and labored. “This is what I’ll have to face” if Kratom is banned, he says, since “the pharmaceutical measures don’t really help; they typically make these issues a little bit worse.”\n\nBy day 6, a rapid succession of tics pull and twist his facial expressions, and his stuttering is uncontrollable. “If this continues on,” he says, “within a few more days I’ll probably have complete inability to speak…[and] the pain I woke up with this morning was very unbearable.”\n\nThousands Share Andrew Turner’s Story\n\nThough Meige syndrome isn’t common, what binds this veteran’s story to thousands of other testimonies from Kratom users is how taking Kratom has allowed them to stop using prescription opiates, or avoid them altogether. As Turner explains: “For a long time I’ve worked with doctors and the DOD to manage my symptoms…turned out that with just a little bit [of Kratom] each morning, I was able to stop using opiates…large amounts of vicodin, Percosets. I haven’t taken any in months…I can do things on my own again without others helping me.”\n\nMany veterans have found success using Kratom to treat chronic pain and PTSD, as founder of American Kratom Association Susan Ash told U.S. News and many wrote to the DEA when it opened the potential regulations for public comment. Abraham, a former U.S. Army sergeant, wrote, “It is one of the only medicines that help tremendously with my PTSD without being hepatotoxic…I had multiple buddies with whom I worked with who were at risk for suicide. They were introduced to Kratom and now are living normal lives.”\n\nMany veterans’ stories can be found on YouTube under the hashtag #IAmKratom. Josh, a disabled veteran with two back surgeries, anxiety, and PTSD told viewers how he “walked around feeling like a zombie” on the 12 medications the military hospital had prescribed him before he switched to Kratom. “I feel better in these 3 years that I’ve had Kratom than the six years before that,” he said.\n\nCurtis, a disabled infantry Army vet, said he was put on pharmaceuticals to help with PTSD and opiate painkillers to manage his chronic pain. “It was a pretty bad time for me…I decided to give [Kratom] a try, and within the first two hours of having my first spoonful, my pain was almost completely gone. Over the first few weeks, my crushing depression and anxiety had started to go away.” He says now he doesn’t take any other medications and can provide for his family.\n\nAsh says she uses Kratom to treat chronic pain from Lyme disease and broke her addiction to opioids with its help. Many other non-veterans testified to its efficacy in managing pain. One woman, 48, wrote, “I suffer excruciating, haneous [sic], debilitating pain EVERY minute of every day. Kratom stopped it dead in its tracks. I am now LIVING. I work again, I’m a mother again, a wife again.”\n\nIs This Leaf Akin to Heroin or Ecstacy?\n\nThousands of such consumers spoke out when in August 2016 the DEA notified the public of its intent to add the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the Schedule I category, a decision “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.” This would have put the ancient herb from Southeast Asia in such unsavory company as heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, and other drugs determined by the DEA to have, “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”\n\nThe DEA has the power to immediately ban a drug, then issue permits for its use as they see fit. Placing Kratom in the Schedule I category may seem drastic considering its comparatively mild nature to other Schedule I drugs, but that’s the only category into which DEA can place drugs if it wants to ban them quickly without express permission from Congress.\n\nJournalist Anthony Roberts reported that within the first week alone more than 100,000 people signed the petition to keep Kratom unscheduled. More than 23,000 posted comments with overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n\nTurner says vendor sales estimate that between 3 and 5 million people in the United States have tried Kratom, and the market is growing. More than 55, 000 kilograms of dried Kratom leaves and powder have been encountered “at ports of entry” to the United States between 2014 and 2016.\n\nAfter the massive outcry from Kratom users, on October 12, 2016 DEA withdrew its plan to schedule Kratom. Spokesman Melvin Patteson said the reversal is “something we’ve never done before.” DEA opened another public comment period and requested that the Food and Drug Administration do an “8 factor analysis” before making a scheduling decision. That analysis has yet to be conducted, but an eight-factor analysis commissioned by the American Kratom Association and performed by PinneyAssociates found Kratom “appears overall much safer [than opioids].”\n\nAccording to Dr. Jack Henningfield, one of the analysis’ authors, “Its favorable safety profile supports continued access by consumers to appropriately regulated products while research on its uses continues.” So prospects look brighter for the botanical than they did just a few months ago.\n\nOther Benefits and Effects of Kratom\n\nThe leaves of the plant in question (Mitragyna Speciosa) have purportedly been used by natives for millennia and, more recently, by U.S. consumers for its calming and analgesic properties; often as an alternative to prescription opioids.\n\nKratom is fairly inexpensive. A low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain. One Kratom user wrote her medications for managing the pain of fibromyalgia were “more than her disability check.” “It’s such a cheap substance,” explains Turner, “You’re not going to have people breaking into homes to finance their Kratom habit.”\n\nPrevious analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester of personal experiences aggregated on Erowid.org (“a psychoactive substance information site”) found among Kratom’s effects, “what appears to be a mild (i.e., relative to opiates) dependence syndrome.”\n\nA low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain.\n\nBut some Kratom users report dependency as a real struggle, some saying it suppresses their creativity and heightens complacency. One user who described himself as “addicted to Kratom for 2 and a half years, typically at 20-25 grams a day” commented on Reddit, “Kratom made me complacent and sloppy, but also stifled my creativity. It’s funny how when you are on kratom your standards sink so low. There’s this weird complacency like ‘since I feel good anything I do is good enough.’”\n\nAnother quitter described the plant as “the green deception” and “a puppeteer.” Still another recreational user reported insomnia, depression, anxiety, and hot and cold sweats while withdrawing from use of 8-12g a day—an amount Turner equates to “shoveling it down” and “chasing a big-time high.” Other users report consumption upwards of 30g a day.\n\nReddit contains multiple threads of negative Kratom experiences, especially withdrawal symptoms. Notably, many are from users who do not report using Kratom to treat pre-existing conditions, report consuming very high doses, or are also on other medications (for instance, the user who reported insomnia was also taking Prozac). Such instances would support the DEA’s position that Kratom is “being abused for its opioid-like properties.”\n\n“It still has risks just like anything one ingests,” Turner said, warning against trying Kratom before doing the research or “chasing a high that just really isn’t there.” “There is no actual high from kratom that you could dare compare to even the mildest opiate,” Ash told U.S. News.\n\nIn low doses (roughly 2-4g), Kratom has a stimulating and “uplifting” effect, and some consumers say it gives them focus and a slight boost of motivation. In higher doses, it tends to act as a depressant and an analgesic, and it is the efficacy of Kratom in this regard that recovering opioid addicts generally testify to. Of all the appeals to keeping Kratom legal, its ability to decrease or eliminate opioid users’ dependence is the strongest.\n\nKratom Could Be an Exit-Ramp Drug\n\nOne man, who became addicted to opium poppies and then to heroin, said of the plant: “Kratom took someone who had no desire, at all, to stop using opiates and allowed me to quit heroin cold turkey, and remain opiate-free for over six years (and counting).”\n\nKristofer also described his experience breaking free of narcotics, “the side effects [from his medication] were absolutely awful…I was headed to the point where I was going to have to be on disability for the rest of my life. I started supplementing Kratom into my diet as needed, and it completely changed my life as well. I have experienced zero side effects, and it has helped me turn my life around to the point where I am able to work a full time job (40 hours+ a week), and provide for my family like I have never been able to do before.”\n\nNarcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nThe nation is in the throes of an opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that more than 33,000 people died from opioid use in 2015, an increase of 72 percent from the previous year, and a figure almost on par with the total traffic fatalities for the same year (35,000). Prescription opioids are powerful, and powerfully addictive. The prescription drug fentanyl, for instance, is “50 times more powerful than heroin,” as noted by CNN. Narcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nSuch highly addictive painkillers as OxyContin and Codeine are the widest gateway to heroin addiction. Amid this overwhelming opiate crisis, the DEA attempted to schedule Kratom as a drug with “no medical use,” with “no investigational new drug applications or approved new drug applications” for its main alkaloids, although the authors of the DEA’s three-factor analysis of Kratom acknowledged the plant’s analgesic properties and noted “Kratom has also been used to self-treat chronic pain and withdrawal symptoms from opioid misuse and dependence.”\n\nThe DEA also cites in the same document the increasing number of Kratom-positive blood or urine samples at private labs, which has gone from 31 positive results in 2012 to 555 positive results for 2015 through March 2016. DEA says this demonstrates rising concern over “the growing abuse” of Kratom products. The administration also cites a “tenfold increase in the number of calls received [at poison control centers] between 2010 and 2015” as evidence of growing Kratom abuse.\n\nCompare Kratom’s Effects to Those of Competing Drugs\n\nOf course, the strongest evidence supporting their case that Kratom use constitutes an “emerging public health threat” would presumable be 30 “Kratom associated deaths,” for all recorded years.\n\nThe DEA’s notice of intent and three-factor analysis calls all Kratom users “abusers.” But “abuser” isn’t found in the list of legal terms for the Controlled Substances Act; neither the FDA nor the DEA have a legal definition for “abuse,” much less “high potential for abuse.” The terms “abuse” and “abuser” are political, flexible enough to fit over an entire group of consumers regardless of the method or purpose of the product’s usage by the individual.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom.\n\nBut to compare Kratom abuse to that of opioids, we’ll employ a common definition of drug abuse, such as, “Compulsive, excessive, and self-damaging use of habit forming drugs or substances, leading to addiction or dependence.”\n\nAccording to national survey data from the Department of Health and Human Services, substance abuse for prescription pain relievers totaled roughly 2 million, and substance abuse for heroin totaled about 591,000 in 2015. That same year, there were, “20,101 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 12,990 overdose deaths related to heroin,” according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Of course, the most obvious sign of abuse are overdose fatalities: ODs from prescription pain relievers quadrupled between 1999 and 2014.\n\nBy contrast, the DEA could point to only 30 recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. According to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. Also, in all but one of those deaths, other substances were found in the systems of the deceased, (including amphetamine, heroin, methadone, and fentanyl).\n\nAs for other indicators of Kratom abuse, 660 Kratom-related calls to poison control centers were recorded between 2010 and 2015. But the CDC study of these calls the DEA cites, by their own admission, determines a correlation between the 50 severe outcomes “and exposure to Kratom plus other substances.” The three-factor analysis could point to a few cases, but no statistics or aggregate data, on other indicators for abuse, such as emergency room admissions or treatment facility admissions.\n\nHow About Regulating Before Banning?\n\nEven if one disputes the DEA’s claim that Kratom is widely abused, the Kratom market is “the wild west” in terms of regulation, as Turner acknowledges. The three-factor analysis notes that Kratom products are often marketed as a “legal high,” and falsely labeled. There is no recommended dosage amount, either. The DEA’s original scheduling notice cited lack of regulation as one of Kratom’s dangers.\n\nYet why try to ban Kratom before considering common-sense regulations? Turner said he and many other Kratom advocates would like to see more common-sense regulation of Kratom, such as restricting the age for purchase to 21 and over, and ensuring the Kratom supply isn’t tainted with harmful chemicals and that the contents are true to the advertised ingredients.\n\nA first step toward this end would be submitting Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient” to the FDA, which includes submitting evidence that Kratom is safe to consume. “I’d love to see the government come in and say we need to have some testing. I’m okay with some oversight,” says Turner, “But there’s a fine line between oversight and overreach.”\n\nWhy Did the DEA Try to Ban Kratom?\n\nWhen the government attempts to ban a substance seemingly out of nowhere, without previous widespread media coverage of the issue or public outcry, often the first suspects are other key players in the industry.\n\nJournalists and Kratom advocates have pointed to Dr. Daniel Fabricant as a force behind the proposed ban, as arguably Kratom’s most outspoken critic. In 2014, Fabricant directed the FDA’s dietary supplements division, and that year the FDA began seizing Kratom imports. In April 2014, however, Fabricant became CEO of the Natural Products Association. NPA senior vice president Corey Hilmas is also an FDA transplant.\n\n‘If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement.’\n\nSince 2014, Fabricant has been nudging regulators to crack down on Kratom. I spoke to Dr. Fabricant, who maintains the botanical should still be scheduled because it exhibits opiate-like behavior.\n\n“If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement,” he said. He chastised advocates for self-treatment. “You’re going to self-diagnose treatment of addiction? There’s no a magic bullet for addiction. People from addiction clinics have said people do get addicted to Kratom. You should be working hand in hand with a health-care provider.”\n\nEven regarding the potential submission of Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient,” he explained that the substance, “has to show baseline acute safety, they have to do a toxicity study…and the extra-curricular question is: is it addictive.” In his view, that question is essential. If we do place preference studies for things that sweeten our coffee, why wouldn’t we do that for Kratom?\n\nFabricant comes across as passionate and sincere about his position. It’s worth noting, however, that some of the NPA’s member companies make and sell products that compete with Kratom (such as “At Ease” and “Brain Awakening,” and formulas for clear thinking or muscle spasms and tension) and would have an interest in how the botanical is regulated.\n\n“It’s more likely that it’s a fear held by the dietary companies,” said Charles Haddow, a representative from the American Kratom Association, “that if it’s as bad people are saying, that there will be a spillover that affects the division…if there are deaths, that it might bring calls to Congress calling for a new regulatory scheme for the industry.”\n\nStill, it’s not as if the Kratom importers and retailers don’t have financial interests at stake in this regulatory battle. “People supporting Kratom are making a lot of money, but they chastise makers of opiates for the same,” Fabricant pointed out. And research to ensure Kratom’s safety costs money, as the CEO acknowledged. But he insisted the Kratom industry isn’t stepping up and taking responsibility in that regard.\n\nChief Opponents Include Competing Substance Companies\n\nIn July of 2013, three organizations—the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, and the United Natural Products Alliance—sent a letter to the FDA expressing concern over Kratom’s lack of regulation. It certainly seems concern from the pharmaceutical and supplement industries triggered the FDA’s interest in Kratom. The FDA’s database reveals no documents about Kratom until a September 2014 news release regarding a Kratom seizure in southern California, and all the firms on the list of products Subject to Detention without Physical Examination under the import alert have dates published 2014 or after.\n\nCross-referencing the members listed for each organization with a 2012 report on narcotics manufacturers from United Nation’s Office of Drugs and Crime, it is revealed that the Council for Responsible Nutrition represents the pharmaceutical companies BASF, which manufactures the psychoactive stimulants cathine and methcathinone, and the opiate painkiller Tilidine; DSM Nutritional Products, which manufactures Bromazepam, Clonazepam, and Diazepam; and Lonza Inc., which makes the depressant GHB and methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat ADHD.\n\nThese drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its ‘perks,’ such as focus and energy.\n\nCHPA represents Chattem Chemicals (a division of Sun Pharma), which manufactures codeine, fentanyl, methadone, morphone, oxycodone, sufentanil; and Purdue Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of OxyContin. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also a member through their division “Teva Women’s Health”; Teva makes a generic for Actiq, a drug containing fentanyl, as well as oxycodone tablets.\n\nThe UNPA represents companies on the natural side of the industry, including Indena USA, which makes extracts from plants like chamomile and Devil’s Claw (used to treat muscle and back pain and migraines), and Morinda, which sells “natural” products, including energy drinks and focus supplements. These drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its “perks,” such as focus and energy.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies are heavyweights: BASF is No. 94 on Forbes’ list of the world’s biggest companies, and in 2015 its nutrition and health products generated 2.1 billion. Purdue generates about $3 billion in revenue annually, mostly from OxyContin sales. Chattem’s parent company, Sun Pharma, brought in about $403 million from U.S. sales in 2013.\n\nWhy wouldn’t these companies monetize the herb themselves instead of pushing for a ban? I asked Turner. Certainly their R&D budgets could create a Kratom product superior to a bitter green powder shipped to consumers in unmarked Ziploc bags or sold as powder capsules in head shops.\n\nLarge pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market.\n\nYet the number of alkaloids in the Kratom leaf (37, according to Fabricant, but sources differ) and their short shelf life once extracted would make manufacturing a synthetic version quite difficult. Even if such companies were selling simple extracts or powder capsules, Turner explained, it would take decades to grow a commercially viable domestic crop, and in the necessary tropical climates like Hawaii or Guam. Large-scale importation would be expensive to start up, too, especially with pre-existing regulatory barriers: the FDA would first need to approve Kratom as a safe dietary ingredient.\n\nTo complicate matters, regulators might require Kratom sellers to change the formulation to sell kratom products as supplements. According to Fabricant, that would mean they’d have to make an extract without the “addictive” main alkaloids. This would be another expensive step, and might render the product impotent.\n\nSo large pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market. Prescription narcotics bring in significant revenue. Pain medications are a $24 billion global market and Kratom’s position as a more tolerable and effective analgesic for many cuts in on the market.\n\nDespite the DEA’s scheduling halt, the FDA has already ordered more seizures of products containing Kratom this year.\n\nWhat About Approval Through the FDA?\n\nThe agencies that regulate what Americans put into their bodies operate on the assumption that anything that is not scientifically proven safe, to varying degrees of satisfaction as determined by the agencies, must be dangerous. As such, it would be more challenging for drug companies to convince the FDA that Kratom is safe, versus convincing them it is dangerous enough to ban.\n\nWhen attempting to enter the market, government agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise. Hence the lengthy clinical trials and years-long waits for FDA approval. To draw a comparison to criminal court: the drug (or dietary supplement) is guilty until proven innocent.\n\nGovernment agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise.\n\nNow, for experimental drugs synthesized in a lab, this makes a great deal of sense. Its potential effects are unknown, or close to it, and to immediately bottle it up and sell it to sick people would be preposterous. The length and breadth of the clinical trials may be up for debate, but testing isn’t just responsible, it’s an ethical obligation.\n\nBut Kratom isn’t an experimental drug, and its effects aren’t unknown. Its psychoactive nature may make some doctors and regulators nervous, but the plant has been used for centuries, and people are using it currently with overwhelmingly positive results.\n\nThe regulatory overseers, however, aren’t satisfied with history and anecdotes. Kratom sellers haven’t supplied the toxicity and place preference studies the FDA would want. Other scientific research is preliminary, but university research indicates Kratom’s main alkaloid, mitragynine, could indeed provide an effective “step-down” from opiate addiction.\n\nBut government science gets it wrong often enough to warrant serious doubts about its competence in regulating, or even advising, on our behaviors and consumption. Consider that it took the National Institute of Health nearly a decade to reverse guidelines on peanut allergies in children after the first studies challenging the wisdom of their approach were published, or the inflated place of dairy in both the old food pyramid and the new “myPlate” guidelines, or the fact that the FDA has set new sodium guidelines for food companies, despite strong evidence that sodium really isn’t all that harmful.\n\nHow About Aiming for Harm Reduction over Abstinence\n\nAbstinence is the chief principle governing the drug war that surrounds Kratom, leading to crackdowns on behaviors as mild as marijuana use, coming down hardest on the suppliers, but punishing users, too. One nurse of 26 years opined, somewhat hyperbolically, that if the DEA really wanted to make a difference, they would dispense Kratom to addicts “who want to get off that destructive merry go round.”\n\nAn agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose.\n\nFabricant believes “We didn’t get to have the safest food supply in the world by letting anyone dump something into the market just because they feel strongly about it.” But Turner is convinced it would be “detrimental to public health” to ban Kratom. To him, enforcing complete abstinence from a substance that is not well-researched in the lab, but that has been overwhelmingly beneficial in the real world, isn’t the answer.\n\n“The addicts have a true chance to get clean,” he said. “There are questions with Kratom, about dependency, but at the end of the day it’s not going to kill anybody.”\n\nThe vast regulatory state, with its lack of accountability to both legislators and the public, and its shared pool of expertise with the private sector it purports to regulate, is ripe for exploitation. An agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose. In the case of Kratom, many of those consumers are suffering and even more vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe fate of Kratom is still in limbo. But may the plant’s close brush with regulatory disaster be a lesson to citizens: the government doesn’t always hold our best interests as a top priority.\n\nGeorgi is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist and host of The 180 Cast , where she interviews people who have changed their minds on important political and social issues.

         "McConnell Would Fill Potential Supreme Court Vacancy In 2020, Reversal Of 2016 Stance\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIn 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to hold a hearing on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, saying that it was an election year and that the American people \"deserved a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nThat was then.\n\nSpeaking to an audience in Kentucky on Monday, McConnell said should a vacancy occur on the court in 2020, another presidential election year, he would allow a vote.\n\nHe was asked at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon: \"Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMcConnell responded with a grin, \"Oh, we'd fill it.\"\n\nThe comments were first reported by CNN.\n\nMcConnell has made similar pronouncements in the past, noting that the nomination of Merrick Garland by Obama came during a time of divided government and that should a vacancy occur with President Trump in the White House and the Senate also under GOP control, circumstances would be different.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to McConnell on Twitter, calling him \"a hypocrite\"\n\nMcConnell's office argued Wednesday morning that his comments were not inconsistent.\n\n\"The Leader has noted on multiple occasions that not since the 1880s has a 'vacancy created in a presidential year' been 'confirmed by the party opposite the occupant of the White House.' His comments in Paducah yesterday simply repeated this. If there is a vacancy next year, because the White House and the Senate are the same party, we would vote to fill the slot,\" McConnell's staff director wrote in an email to reporters listing previous statements.\n\nIn his remarks to the luncheon on Tuesday, McConnell stressed the importance he places on putting conservatives in judgeships, even more than legislative accomplishments.\n\n\"What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\" McConnell said. \"That's the most important thing we've done for the country, which cannot be undone.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere are two justices on the high court who are in their 80s, and Democrats have worried for some time about the health of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. By denying Garland a seat, McConnell has assured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a foreseeable future, with the confirmations of Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and of Brett Kavanaugh last year.",

         "Story highlights Commander Yusuf Abdi Ali is accused of \"overseeing some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine.\" He has been quietly living in the U.S. for 20 years. He passed a background check to work at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nCNN —\n\nAn accused war criminal living in the United States is now working as a security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nA CNN investigation found that Yusuf Abdi Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities while he was a military commander during Somalia’s brutal civil war, has been living a quiet life near the nation’s capital for about 20 years.\n\nHe is just one of more than 1,000 accused war criminals living and working in the United States.\n\nMass graves and haunting stories\n\nCourtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Mass grave reveals Somalia's bloody past Prev Next\n\nIn a shallow pit in northern Somalia, forensic anthropologists have been delicately digging around battered bones that were recently found in numerous mass graves. They’re the remains of a clan slaughtered during the war in the 1980s, alleged evidence of the brutality carried out by the government regime in power at the time.\n\nLed by Mohamed Siad Barre, the regime took over Somalia after a coup in 1969 and ruled with an iron fist. In the north, the dominant Isaaq clan was heavily repressed and brutalized by government forces, according to human rights experts.\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali served as a commander in the Barre regime and is accused of terrorizing the Isaaq people, torturing clan members, burning villages and conducting mass executions.\n\nSeveral villagers described these atrocities in a documentary that aired on the Canadian network CBC in 1992. One witness claimed Ali captured and killed a family member.\n\n“He tied (my brother) to military vehicle and dragged him behind. He said to us if you’ve got enough power, get him back,” the villager said. “He shredded him into pieces. That’s how he died.”\n\nCNN found that, today, Ali is living a normal suburban life just outside of the nation’s capital, in Alexandria, VA. He shares an apartment with his wife and works as a security guard at Dulles, one of the busiest airports in the country.\n\nAs a result of CNN’s investigation, Ali has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nSomali President Mohamed Siad Barre in May 1990. MIKE NELSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAli’s employer Master Security has a contract with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to provide unarmed security services. Ali passed a “full, federally mandated vetting process” that included an FBI background check and a TSA assessment.\n\nHowever, when CNN initially asked Master Security about Ali, the company said it was “unaware of the pending litigation.”\n\nIn light of the “very serious nature of the allegations,” Ali is on administrative leave, and the company is reviewing the case, according to Chief Executive Rick Cucina. Ali’s airport access has also been withdrawn.\n\nThe case against Ali\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali\n\nAli is being sued in a U.S. civil court. The lawsuit, which a human rights group initially filed in 2006, calls Ali a “war criminal” who committed “crimes against humanity.”\n\n“He oversaw some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine,” said Kathy Roberts, an attorney for the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), which is leading the civil suit. “He tortured people personally; he oversaw torture.”\n\nThe case has had numerous twists and appeals over the years. The most recent happened in February, when the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only part of the case can move forward – the lawsuit’s claims that Ali tortured and attempted to murder the plaintiff. The other part of the suit – claims that he committed “war crimes” – cannot because those alleged crimes happened outside of the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to hear it, it could become a landmark case over whether foreigners living in the U.S. can be held accountable for crimes allegedly committed overseas.\n\nRoberts claims Ali is directly responsible for these atrocities, painting disturbing images of acts he allegedly committed.\n\nRebels of Somali National Movement (SNM) sit on their beds in November 1989 in Leila, northern Somalia. ALEXANDER JOE/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“He arrested people, stole their stuff, burned villages, executed masses of people,” Roberts said. “At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nAli and his lawyer, Joseph Peter Drennan, deny all accusations listed in the CJA lawsuit.\n\nWhen CNN approached Ali outside his apartment in Alexandria, he declined an interview, telling correspondent Kyra Phillips: “To tell you the truth, all is false. Baseless.”\n\n“How dare anyone call him a war criminal,” Drennan told CNN. “Those are just allegations. If he is indeed a war criminal, take him to The Hague. Or if he is a war criminal, take it up with the immigration authorities. Don’t sue him in an American court… My client deserves to live in the U.S. just as any other legal permanent resident.”\n\nHowever, there is no criminal court in the world that can try Ali for war crimes. One key reason for this is that no criminal court really has jurisdiction to do so.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague wasn’t formally envisioned until 1994, following the genocide in Rwanda. The ICC didn’t issue its first arrest warrants until a decade later.\n\n“At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nOther special war crimes or genocide tribunals, such as those in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Cambodia, were only created for the specific areas where those crimes took place. Somalia has never been able to develop a complete justice system that could embark on such a tribunal.\n\nThe U.S. doesn’t have jurisdiction over the events that played out in Somalia in the 1980s, even though Ali has ties to the U.S. military. At the time, the Siad Barre government was a U.S. ally. Thus, American officials considered many military soldiers and commanders, including Ali, to be fighting for U.S. interests.\n\nDrennan asks: If the Defense Department had no problem with Ali, why should anyone else?\n\n“My client has never been adjudicated to have committed any wrongful acts of any sort, much less be correctly seen as a war criminal,” Drennan said. “He is not a war criminal.”\n\nThe U.S. government says its investigators have been aware of Ali for years, “based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, officials refused to provide further details.\n\nThe suspected war criminals among us\n\nAli is just one of many people who are living in the United States despite being accused of committing some of the worst violence in modern times.\n\nThese people – most of whom are men – are accused of crimes such as mass murder in El Salvador; torture and murder in Chile; ethnic cleansing in Somalia. Some are even wanted in their homelands, with outstanding extradition requests to remove them from the U.S. so they can be held accountable for their crimes.\n\nYet they continue to lead typical American lives, with some even working jobs in high-profile positions.\n\n“There’s about 1,000 suspected perpetrators in the United States,” Roberts said.\n\nRoberts and CJA say Americans should know that accused war criminals and suspected human rights violators are living across the country.\n\n“It fundamentally violates what we could call American values,” Roberts said. “But I really would rather say human values – to allow people like this to get off scot-free, and to allow them to benefit from the rule of law that they deprived their victims of, and they need to be held accountable.”\n\nAli ended up in Canada after the Barre military regime collapsed in 1991. But he was deported several years later after news about his alleged war crimes in Somalia became public through the CBC documentary.\n\nAli entered the U.S. on a visa through his Somali wife, Intisar Farah, who became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, she was found guilty of naturalization fraud for claiming she was a refugee from the very Somali clan that Ali is accused of torturing.\n\nFrom Somalia to Dulles\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali, working security at Dulles International Airport. CNN\n\nDrennan said there should be no concerns whatsoever that Ali was working at an airport. Roberts, however, disagrees.\n\n“It’s very deeply disturbing, in part because that is a position of trust,” she said. “He abused that authority terribly in Somalia, and while I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\n“… While I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials declined to comment on Ali’s case, or on other alleged war criminals, but they did confirm that he was known to the agency.\n\nIn a statement ICE wrote: “Yusuf Ali came to the attention of investigators and attorneys within the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, ICE’s legacy agency, based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, ICE officials would not clarify why Ali has been allowed to remain in the U.S.\n\nIn the last 12 years, ICE’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center has arrested more than 360 people “for human rights-related violations.” The agency has also removed more than 780 known or suspected human rights violators from the U.S. It currently has more than 125 active investigations.",

         "Story highlights NEW: Multiple officials identify the shooter as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer Ten people were killed and another seven were injured, sheriff says Thoughts and prayers are \"not enough,\" says President Barack Obama\n\nCNN —\n\n[Breaking news update 11:38 p.m. ET]\n\nThe gunman who opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College targeted Christians specifically, according to the father of a wounded student.\n\nBefore going into spinal surgery, Anastasia Boylan told her father and brother the gunman entered her classroom firing. The professor in the classroom was shot point blank. Others were hit, she told her family.\n\nEveryone in the classroom dropped to the ground.\n\nThe gunman, while reloading his handgun, ordered the students to stand up if they were Christians, Boylan told her family.\n\n“And they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,’” Boylan’s father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account.\n\n“And then he shot and killed them.”\n\n[Last update posted at 11:28 p.m. ET]\n\n(CNN ) – Ten people were killed when a gunman opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College on Thursday, forcing the nation to face yet another mass shooting.\n\nSeven other people were injured, and the shooter is dead, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters. Earlier estimates had put the number of people hurt much higher.\n\nMultiple law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Investigators have interviewed members of his family and friends, they said.\n\n“I will not name the shooter,” Hanlin said. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought.”\n\nAuthorities credited a quick response by law enforcement for keeping the death toll from climbing higher.\n\nA law enforcement official said the shooter had body armor with him and was heavily armed, with a large amount of ammunition – enough for a prolonged gunfight.\n\nHanlin said tactical teams and bomb squads had cleared the buildings on campus and were working to clear hundreds of vehicles parked on campus.\n\nHuddled together\n\nCassandra Welding is a student at the Roseburg campus and was in class when the shooting started.\n\n“I heard a popping noise, almost like a balloon popping,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I knew something wasn’t right and so I get down.”\n\nShe said all of the students in her classroom dropped to the ground. They huddled together behind backpacks and chairs, underneath tables.\n\n“We locked the doors, turned off the lights, and we were all pretty much in panic mode,” Welding said.\n\n“We called 911 and called our parents, our loved ones … We didn’t know what was going to happen, if those were our last words or not.”\n\nCommunity members attend a candlelight vigil at Stewart Park for those killed during a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday, October 1. The massacre left nine people dead and nine wounded. The gunman also died. Gosia Wozniacka/AP In response to the shooting on October 1, President Barack Obama delivers the 15th statement of his presidency addressing gun violence. \"Somehow this has become routine,\" he said. \"The reporting is routine.

Aaron Yost/The News-Review/AP Shooting at Oregon community college Prev Next\n\nThe shooting\n\nThe shooting appears to have started in one building before the gunman moved to the school’s science building, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Those killed and wounded were found in at least two classrooms.\n\n“We arrived to find multiple patients in multiple classrooms. Law enforcement was on scene and had the shooter neutralized,” said Douglas County Fire Marshal Ray Shoufler.\n\nHe told CNN that two patients died while being transported to a hospital.\n\nMercy Medical Center posted on Facebook that it had received 10 patients. The extent of their injuries was not known.\n\nThree female victims were at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield, according to a hospital spokeswoman.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear why the hospitals’ numbers conflicted with the figure provided by Sheriff Hanlin.\n\nA law enforcement official told CNN three pistols and one rifle believed to have belonged to the suspect were recovered at the scene.\n\nATF agents were also on scene and canine teams were en route to search for explosives, fire arms casings and ammunition, a spokesman said. FBI agents were en route.\n\nThe community\n\nRoseburg is a city of about 22,000 people about 70 miles south of Eugene, Oregon, and some 180 miles south of Portland.\n\nThe school itself is up on a hill outside the city center, according to Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst who lives nearby. Francona said that logging is a big industry in the region, which is fairly rural but easily accessible from Interstate 5.\n\nOregon shooting shatters ‘peaceful’ enclave\n\n“This is so out of character for this whole area,” he said.\n\nNews of the shooting quickly reached Washington, with the state’s senior senator, Ron Wyden, visibly shaken and Sen. Jeff Merkley tweeting that he was praying for the victims and their families.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation and will continue to receive updates throughout the day.\n\nHe pushed for a change in gun laws when he spoke to reporters about the shooting Thursday.\n\n“Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this,” he said.\n\nThe President continued: “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America – next week, or a couple months from now.”\n\nThe school\n\nA picturesque campus in the North Umpqua River Valley, Umpqua Community College prides itself on a “a peaceful, safe atmosphere, and year-round recreational activities,” according to its website.\n\nIt’s not a traditional institution of higher learning, as the average age of its 13,600 students was 38 during the 2013-2014 school year. Only 740 of those were full time, 2,437 were part time and more than 10,000 fell under the umbrella of “community education.”\n\nIt first began teaching classes out of rented facilities in 1961. Elton and Ruth Jackson donated 98.5 acres to house the campus in 1965.\n\nThe school will be closed until Monday as a result of the shooting.\n\nThe interim leader of Umpqua Community College called Thursday “the saddest day in the history of the college.”\n\nAre you there?

         "Calling Nurse A 'Hero,' Utah Hospital Bars Police From Patient-Care Areas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP\n\nUpdated 8:35 p.m. ET\n\nThe Salt Lake City hospital where a police officer roughly arrested a nurse who was protecting her patient's rights in July will no longer allow law enforcement agents inside its patient care areas. They'll now have to check in rather than enter through the emergency room.\n\n\"Law enforcement who come to the hospital for any reason involving patients will be required to check in to the front desk of the hospital,\" said chief nursing officer Margaret Pearce of the University of Utah Hospital. \"There, a hospital house supervisor will meet the officers to work through each request.\"\n\nHospital officials say they created the policy one day after the July incident in which nurse Alex Wubbels refused to allow a police investigator identified as Jeff Payne to get a blood sample from a patient who was injured in a deadly collision with another driver. Wubbels was following the hospital's policy (and a recent Supreme Court decision) that requires either a warrant, the patient's consent or the patient being under arrest for such a sample to be obtained legally.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment bars blood tests from being obtained without a warrant in drunken-driving cases.\n\n\"Our hospital continues to offer our full support to Alex,\" said Gordon Crabtree, the hospital system's CEO. \"I think many of you know she is an Olympian, and to us she's truly an Olympic-size hero. We extend our appreciation for her dedication and service.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile Wubbels' superiors said she had shown professional integrity and grace under fire, the officer's bosses and Salt Lake City's mayor have issued apologies for his behavior. He is on administrative leave while the case is being investigated.\n\nThe encounter between Wubbels and Payne took place on July 26 — but it made headlines last Thursday, when body camera footage of the dispute was released. The video shows Wubbels referring to her hospital's privacy policy and speaking with a supervisor on her cellphone as she denies the officer's request for a blood sample from a patient.\n\nHaving failed to persuade Wubbels to allow him to obtain blood from the patient, the officer begins grabbing at the nurse and then forcefully pulls her outside the hospital as she yells for help. He then handcuffs her and puts her in a police car parked at the hospital.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Our team was advocating for the immediate release of Alex and was ultimately successful in getting her released from the handcuffs and the car,\" Crabtree said on Monday. \"Alex was never charged and will not have a record.\"\n\nOther hospitals will very likely want to adopt similar policies to prevent police overreach, Crabtree said.\n\nPearce said she was \"appalled\" at the encounter. She added:\n\n\"We are a Level 1 Trauma Center with the only dedicated burn unit in the Mountain West region and we have some of the sickest patients anywhere. Because of this, we work with law enforcement on a regular basis for a variety of reasons and will continue to do so. However, I consider the way in which Alex was treated to be totally unacceptable. No individual in a role of patient care should ever be treated in this fashion.\"\n\nThe new policy \"was written the day after this incident\" and was implemented within weeks, Pearce said. Here's how she described the goals for the change:\n\nAllow front-line patient care staff to focus on their work.\n\nPrevent disputes from taking place inside patient care units.\n\nEnsure only \"highly trained people\" work through such issues.\n\nAs we've reported, Wubbels is a former two-time Olympic skier.\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department says it suspended Payne from its \"blood draw program,\" in which it trains officers to take blood samples. It adds that it updated its policies for officers who remain in the group.\n\nPayne has also been fired from his part-time paramedic job with a private ambulance service.\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake City Tribune, the patient in question was truck driver William Gray — who also works as a reserve police officer in Rigby, Idaho, and whose tractor-trailer collided with a vehicle that was being pursued by police.\n\nCiting Payne's police report, the Tribune describes the highway crash that led to the hospital confrontation:\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"At about 2 p.m. on July 26, Gray was driving a semi north on State Road 89/91 near Sardine Canyon when a man fleeing from the Utah Highway Patrol crashed a pickup truck into him head-on, according to Logan police, who investigated the collision.\n\n\"The crash caused an explosion and fire, Logan police have said. Gray was on fire when he exited the semi. The driver of the pickup truck, Marcos Torres, 26, died at the scene.\"",

Here are some tips for losing weight.\n\nInstead of taking the escalator, consider scaling the building\n\nSave your troughs for special occasions and switch to eating off plates and bowls for most meals\n\nEarning more than $90,000 a year is a great way to start\n\nYou have to try whatever it is Rachel’s doing—she looks fantastic!\n\nMake yourself really earn unhealthy treats by keeping them in a sealed box at the top of a 15-foot greased pole\n\nEat as much cabbage soup as you want, pal\n\nTo become more mindful of how much you’re eating, try breathing between bites\n\nInstead of taking the car for short trips, consider walking, or at least rolling\n\nTry to squeeze into your old wedding dress, tear it a little bit, and then sit and cry with it halfway up your hips\n\nDon’t get discouraged if you slip up with your diet—just start fresh in a year or so",

         "News Articles On ‘Child Suicide Game’ Targeting Vulnerable Parents Share:\n\nVULNERABLE parents as young as 15 are being warned of the dangers of ‘clickbait’ style news articles designed to spread fear and panic around a self-harming game called ‘Momo’, WWN can confirm.\n\nExperts have warned children that the majority of the news articles depict an image of a distorted woman with sensational headlines and can lure parents into a state of panic in a matter of seconds.\n\n“If you see your parent reading such articles please reassure them that everything is going to be okay,” said chief executive of WebSafe Ireland, Thomas Jockey. “Parents may go temporarily insane and start searching through your devices and there may also be a period of time that your YouTube app will be deleted in exchange for the Kids YouTube app, but don’t worry; this is only temporary”.\n\nThe articles, which have now gone more viral than the game they’re covering thus exposing millions of children to something they had never heard of before, feature across all mainstream media platforms and are more or less worded in the same scaremongering style and come with thousands of naive comments from parents.\n\n“I caught my mother searching through my iPad and had to have ‘the talk’ with her,” explains 7-year-old Saoirse Hogan from Lucan, “once you explain that you’re not that stupid as to go harm yourself over a stupid game, then they seem to calm down a bit,” adding, “Sure God bless their cotton socks, if they only knew the real life stuff online we’d be watching, they’d actually have reason to be scared”.",

         "3 Californias? The initiative to break up the state may be on the ballot in November",
         "CNN —\n\nShould the country’s most populous state be split into three separate states? California voters might be able to make that decision this fall.\n\nA local venture capitalist’s proposal to break up California, “CAL 3,” gained nearly double the necessary signatures to get it on the ballot in November, which will allow state voters to decide on the partition.\n\nTim Draper announced Thursday that his initiative had gotten more than 600,000 signatures from registered voters across all of the state’s 58 counties, surpassing the 365,880 signatures required by state law.\n\n“This is an unprecedented show of support on behalf of every corner of California to create three state governments that emphasize representation, responsiveness, reliability and regional identity,” Draper said.\n\nHow could this help California?\n\nAccording to the proposal, first announced in November, this will solve California’s most pressing issues, including the state’s failing school systems, high taxes, deteriorating infrastructure and strained government.\n\nDraper explained that partitioning California into three states would empower regional communities to make better and more sensible decisions for their citizens.\n\n“To create three states from a standing start, you’ll get all the benefits of knowing all the things that worked in the past, and all the things that could work in the future and you get to eliminate all the baggage you got in the state,” Draper said in a news conference Thursday night at Draper University.\n\n“When you get together and you start something fresh, you have a new way to look at it and create better things” he added.\n\nThe 3 smaller states\n\nDraper also suggests that California citizens would be better served by three smaller state governments while preserving the historic boundaries of the various counties, cities and towns.\n\nCalifornia: This will be considered the new state which includes Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey and San Benito counties.\n\nSouthern California: San Diego, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, Mono, Madera, Inyo, Tulare, Fresno, Kings, Kern and Imperial counties.\n\nNorthern California: This would include the Bay Area and the 31 remaining counties north of Sacramento.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nDraper says CAL 3 will deliver the 600,000 signatures to the secretary of state next week and the signatures will then have to be vetted and approved.\n\nCNN reached out to Secretary of State Alex Padilla, but he refused to comment until he receives the signatures.\n\nIf the measure is approved by voters, the governor will transfer the notice of state approval to Congress, which will\n\nvote to ratify the creation of the new three-state structure.\n\nConstitutional lawyer and professor Jonathan Turley told CNN that congressional approval is not impossible, but not likely to happen, as Democrats could feel they have too much to lose.\n\n“Dems consider California to be a single golden empire, it would be hard for them to accept it as three golden empires.”\n\nTurley explained that with the creation of two new states, this would likely add four new members to the US Senate, something that could create endless tensions between representatives.\n\nDraper backed a proposal to turn California into six states in 2014 but it failed to get the required number of signatures to qualify, and the measure was not presented to voters in the 2016 polls.",

         "NIMRUD, IRAQ—Popping open a bottle of champagne and dancing with a mummified corpse in celebration, Smithsonian Institution archeologist Dr. Kathleen Roberts confessed she was “excited as all hell” Thursday after “hitting the mass grave jackpot” in northern Iraq. “Booyah! I mean, seriously, fuck yeah—we’re rolling in bones, baby,” said Roberts, throwing handfuls of Holocene-era rib bones into the air and standing under the confetti-like cascade of osseous chips. “Rang-a-dang, suckers! This is why I got into the business. I mean, you hear about people hitting the burial site lottery like this, but you never think it’s going to happen to you. There must be a 10-foot layer of bones down there! We got warrior bones, kids’ bones, skeletons of virgins tied to stakes. It must have been an absolute bloodbath. Truly horrific. I’m gonna be stinking rich! No more trying to get excited about a body here or a possible sacrifice there. Just goes to show, you gotta keep playing to win though.” Roberts then stripped to her underwear, lustily rubbed her hands together, and dove headfirst into the staggering assemblage of scientifically significant ancient remains.",

         "AMBUSH: Pennsylvania gunman turns gun on self after killing cop and pregnant woman",
         "The gunman who opened fire on two police officers southwest of Pittsburgh, killing one and wounding the other, apparently killed himself in the home where he was hiding out Thursday morning, CBS Pittsburgh reported.\n\nThe gunman, named by local media as Michael Cwiklinski, was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the house in the town of Canonsburg. Police also recovered the body of a woman who was six months pregnant and had a Protection From Abuse order against the suspected killer.\n\nPOLICE SEE HEIGHTENED THREAT OF AMBUSH\n\nState Police Trooper Melinda Bondarenka told reporters that the officers were immediately met with gunfire when they arrived at the scene at about 3:15 a.m. Bonderanka said the police were “ambushed upon their arrival.”\n\nNeighbors told reporters that police were often called to fights at the home where the shooting unfolded.\n\nPSP Tpr. Melinda Bondarenka speaking about two officers shot in Canonsburg pic.twitter.com/bhuxh0SBUV — Megan (@meganguzaTrib) November 10, 2016\n\nCONVICTED FELON WHO KILLED ARIZONA POLICE OFFICER IS SHOT DEAD AFTER STANDOFF\n\nThe officer who died was identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum, according to the CBS report. He died at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe scene was chaotic, according to witnesses.\n\n“It woke me from bed about 3:30, 4 o’clock this morning,” one neighbor told the station. “I could hear what I thought was firecrackers and then I heard somebody say, ‘My partner’s down,’ or something like that. Then, all hell broke loose. I had my porch light on and he came and told us to turn the light off and stay put.”\n\nClasses at nearby schools were delayed or canceled amid the heavy police presence. Homes in the Canonsburg area were evacuated.\n\nLast week, a New York City police sergeant was shot and killed and a second one was wounded in a gunfight on a street with an armed man who had broken into his estranged wife's home.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

A police officer was fatally shot as he sat in his patrol car three days after the bombing.\n\nU.S. District Judge George O’Toole denied the motion for a new trial Friday. O'Toole presided over Tsarnaev's trial.\n\nRelated: When Radicalization Begins at Home\n\nTsarnaev’s attorneys filed the motion for a new trial on July 6. They argued the publicity surrounding the case made it impossible for Tsarnaev to get a fair trial and said he should have been tried somewhere other than Boston.\n\nO’Toole wrote in his opinion that the location mattered little, as the bombings were followed by the nation and the world. “This was not a crime that was unknown outside of Boston,” O’Toole wrote.\n\nThe motion denied Friday is the first round of appeals lawyers for Tsarnaev are expected to file in the case.\n\nCourt documents also filed include an amended order requiring Tsarnaev to pay a total of $101,124,027 in restitution to 49 victims and the Massachusetts Victim Compensation Fund.",

         "Champion’s League Writer Hired To Script Final Game Of Thrones Episodes Share:\n\nAFTER penning the compelling twists and turns of this season’s Champion’s League, the writer of the football epic has been parachuted in at the last minute to rewrite HBO’s Game of Thrones final outings.\n\nHeart-stopping and ingenious outcomes no one saw coming in the Liverpool v Barcelona and Ajax v Spurs episodes have landed largely unknown writer Gary Tindall the chance to craft a satisfying ending for HBO’s popular fantasy.\n\n“If anyone can do it, it’s that lad,” confirmed one TV viewer who cried when watching relatively new Champion’s League character Mauricio Pochettino drop to his knees in tears as Lucas Moura emerged from nowhere to slay Ajax with a hattrick.\n\nTindall first came to the attention of Hollywood after penning the Leicester season of the Premier League and is now taking his flair for white knuckle adrenaline rides with unbelievable outcomes and unlikely heroes to Game of Thrones, hoping to turnaround the mixed reviews season 8 has endured so far.\n\n“A 4-0 to Liverpool? A 96th minute winner and hattrick from Lucas Moura? I would have said that sounded so ridiculous and shit, but somehow he makes it work perfectly. I’m glad he killed off that Ajax plot too, a team made of youngsters beating the rich elites? That’s a step too far,” added another football viewer.\n\nMany people thought the Champion’s League had it best episodes behind it with the Man United v PSG game and the epic battles of Ajax against Real and Juve but with these latest episodes receiving a 9.9 rating on IMDB viewers are excitedly speculating on who will emerge with the crown after June the 1st’s finale.",

         "The inmates at North Carolina’s Hyde Correctional Institution hung three banners from the prison fence last week as supporters gathered outside. One sign asked for better food; another requested parole; the third said, “In solidarity.”\n\nThe protest came in support of a nationwide prisoner strike to call attention to the low inmate wages, decrepit facilities and harsh sentences that organizers say plague prison populations across the country. Though it is unclear how widespread such demonstrations have been, activists said they had shown a new ability to reach inmates across state lines at a time when prison unrest and in-custody deaths are frequently in the news.\n\n“Prisoners aren’t oblivious to their reality,” said Paul Wright, the executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center and a longtime critic of prison conditions. “They see people dying around them. They see the financial exploitation. They see the injustice.”\n\nInmate protests have been happening for generations, but it is only in the last few years that organizers have had success coordinating from penitentiary to penitentiary and state to state. In 2010, Georgia inmates used contraband cellphones to coordinate protests across at least six prisons. And in 2016, prisoners in several states stopped reporting for work to protest their wages.",

There is a slight risk for severe weather from northern Virginia through parts of central New York. The main risk is damaging winds, large hail and brief tornadoes.\n\nAny storm will also have the potential to bring torrential rain, which can cause flash flooding.\n\nSevere storms are possible in the Northeast on Sunday.

         "Jacob Rees-Mogg Rescued After Slipping Through Street Grate Share:\n\nBREXIT champion Jacob Rees-Mogg is recovering with a nice warm bowl of thin, strained mushroom soup following a harrowing four hours spent trapped in a rain gulley after slipping through the bars of a street grate.\n\nThe beloved Conservative had just stepped out of the Houses Of Parliament for his customary Greggs Steak Bake mid-morning snack, when he stopped to wave at a large group of fans and well-wishers who had gathered outside to congratulate him on another productive round of Brexit talks.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Rees-Mogg, by turning slightly to the left to blow kisses at his fanclub he inadvertently made himself narrower than the the grating he was standing on, and vanished out of sight. Emergency crews located the North East Somerset MP in the drains below, and a daring rescue ensued.\n\n“If we’d have lost old Jacob, I’d say this whole Brexit thing would have been ruined beyond repair,” said one relieved member of the rescue team as Rees-Mogg was winched to safety with a spool of thread.\n\n“Great to have him up over the ground again. Now he can go back in there and help to make sure that Brexit is carried off properly, so that we get everything we deserve as a nation without causing any barney or pallaver or knees up for nobody, innit”.\n\nUPDATE: Mister Rees-Mogg has asked us to remove the phrase ‘harrowing’ from our article as it suggests he may be involved with Harrow University; He is an Eton man, and we are not to forget it.",

         "Washington man first to buy legal weed in Spokane is fired after spotted on news",
         "His high was quickly brought low.\n\nA Spokane, Wash. man was fired from his job as a security guard the same day he became the first person to legally buy weed in the city Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t regret it,” Mike Boyer told the Daily News Wednesday. “I’m sad it happened but I got the title: I’m No. 1. I regret nothing.”\n\nBoyer took Tuesday off from his job and set up camp outside Spokane Green Leaf around 7 p.m. Monday. Almost 20 hours later, around 2 p.m. Tuesday, Boyer was first in the door when the pot dispensary opened its doors to sell legal marijuana.\n\n“We don’t line up for Black Friday, we line up for ‘Green Tuesday,'” the 30-year-old told The News. “People camp out for Star Wars and donuts … this is more important than that.”\n\nMike Boyer, 30, featured on newscast as the first person to legally buy weed in Spokane, Wash. Is promptly fired from his job as a security guard after he’s featured on a local newscast.\n\nDressed in sunglasses and a garish tie-dye T-shirt, Boyer yelled, “Go Washington!” as he made his historic purchase.\n\nHe walked out with four grams of Sour Kush and high-fived people waiting in line as he held his bag of weed aloft, yelling “first customer!” as he walked to his car and immediately went home to get high.\n\nMike Boyer, 30, picks out his Sour Kush at a Spokane, Wash. dispensary on Tuesday.\n\nBoyer’s phone buzzed as he took his first few hits: His employer wanted him to come in and take a urine analysis test within 24 hours. A client had seen the security guard on a newscast and was concerned about the drug use, Boyer said.\n\nThe test came back positive for THC, according to Boyer.\n\nBoyer exaults after he makes the first legal weed purchase in Spokane.\n\n“I’ve worked for them on and off for 12 years and several years ago, I signed a document that said I wouldn’t have (THC) in my system,” he said. “I don’t smoke at work!”\n\n“It’s the first day, who’s not gonna run down?” Boyer added. “People who hadn’t smoked since the ’70s and ’80s were coming down just to be there. It was the day of days.”\n\nMike Boyer, 30, is excited as he’s allowed into Green Leaf Spokane.\n\nAfter being fired, the Spokane native posted his resume to Craigslist in the hopes of landing a new gig — hopefully in the marijuana industry, he said.\n\n“I’m staying positive,” Boyer said.\n\nRecreational marijuana was officially sold legally beginning on Tuesday.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?

         "Friend Thinks Her Loser Boyfriend Could Be Friends With Your Boyfriend Share:\n\nIN A BEWILDERING act that defies all basic logic one Waterford friend thinks her boyfriend would somehow be cool enough to be best friends with your boyfriend.\n\nKayla O’Brien (26), who started seeing her boyfriend Ian only a few months ago is under the false impression he’s as ‘gas’, ‘funny’, ‘cool’ and ‘sound’ as your boyfriend.\n\n“Look I’m happy for her, but the hack of her boyfriend, he’s not even the same species as my fella,” you remarked in a bid to soften the blow, and that if anything, Ian was a bit strange to be honest.\n\nAttempting to set up one another’s boyfriends on a play-date is a time honoured tradition among the nation’s girlfriend population, however, it is only ever permissible when it is clear the men share much of the same interests, and roughly resemble one another personality wise, as outlined by experts in this field.\n\n“The imbalance is struck when one woman mistakenly believes her boyfriend can even claim to be the same species as someone else’s far superior boyfriend. This can cause grave offence to the friend; the idea, that her dear friend can look at her amazing boyfriend and think that her pathetic spaghetti-limbed eejit of a man could be considered worthy of his friendship,” explained relationship expert Dr. Herbert Henderson.\n\nThings are expected to get more tense when Kayla reacts poorly to news that your boyfriend ‘is sick’ again and that’s why he hasn’t been able to ‘just meet up for a drink, nothing mad like’ with Ian on any of the last 17 evenings suggested for a double date or play date.\n\n“Oh look at them there, thick as thieves,” Kayla remarked to you the last time the four of you met up together, completely unaware your boyfriend was sending you secret glances which clearly stated ‘don’t make me hang out with this dry shite again’.",

         "‘The Name On My Birth Certificate Is Actually “The ‘Dwayne Johnson’ Rock,” But People Always Get It Mixed Up’: 5 Questions With Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson\n\nDwayne Johnson is unstoppable. From WWE championships to the box office, the wrestler turned actor has dominated every arena in which he’s competed so far, and if the rumors are true, the world of politics may be next. We sat down with Dwayne Johnson to discuss fatherhood, fitness, and his alleged political ambitions.\n\n1. You’ve accomplished so much in your career, yet you’re still working harder than anyone else in Hollywood right now. What’s driven you to succeed over the years?\n\nMy goal was always to become both strong and famous enough that if I were to try to lift Louie Anderson up over my head, people would see us and say, “Look at The Rock picking up that big blond man. That’s nice of him,” instead of, “That pathetic nobody is not strong enough to pick up Louie Anderson.” In order to accomplish this, I first needed to be strong enough to lift Louie Anderson over my head, but I also needed to be famous enough that onlookers would be too distracted by my presence to notice I’m with Emmy-winning comedian and actor Louie Anderson. Suffice it to say, it’s been a long, long road getting to where I am now.\n\n2. How did you come up with the nickname “The Rock”?\n\nMy birth name is actually The Rock, and “Dwayne Johnson” is my nickname. People always mix it up, but I prefer to be called The “Dwayne Johnson” Rock in that order. Both “The” and “Rock” are family names that have been passed down for generations, whereas I just thought that “Dwayne Johnson” sounded right and started going by that when I began wrestling.\n\n3. You were a wrestling champion before you were a film actor. How do you think your wrestling experience has impacted your acting career?\n\nWell, for one thing, I know exactly how thick Hulk Hogan’s neck is. And I think that’s made my acting career much more difficult, because every time a scene calls for me to strangle someone, I automatically widen my hands to the exact girth of Hulk Hogan’s neck. And that’s not always the correct size of neck as described in the script.\n\n4. How long do you plan to stay involved in the Fast & Furious franchise?\n\nAs long as I can. Every day I live in fear of the time when self-driving cars gain the ability to jump a drawbridge, or haul ass backwards down a parking garage at 60 mph. When that day arrives, they won’t need me to star in any more movies. Self-driving cars are killing the Fast & Furious industry. Hell, even Vin Diesel has started taking coding classes so he’ll be ready for when he gets automated out of his job.\n\n5. You’ve dropped a few hints that you might run for president in 2020. What would your message be if you did?\n\nI think that working people in this country are tired. They’re tired of constantly ripping their T-shirts whenever they flex their 20-inch biceps. They’re sick of having to eat 14 pounds of cod per day just to maintain their incredible 4 percent body fat, and I think they’re fed up with a system that doesn’t respect the tremendous work they’ve done recently to define their traps and lats. It’s time for a change.",

         "Researchers No Closer To Understanding What The Fuck You’re Talking About",
         "CAMBRIDGE, MA—Finding themselves increasingly frustrated after years of fruitless analysis, researchers working with a Harvard-coordinated international multi-university research initiative published a report Monday confirming that, despite spending several years and millions of dollars, they have made negligible progress in understanding what the fuck you’re talking about. “Not only are we no closer to understanding what the hell you’re talking about, but evidence also suggests we are further than ever from a solid idea of exactly what the fuck you think you’re talking about. We’re beginning to suspect you may not even know what the fuck you’re talking about, and unfortunately for those charged with cataloguing what the fuck you’re talking about, you simply won’t fucking stop talking,” the report read in part. “Moreover, researchers at Oxford say they ‘have no goddamn idea what you’re on about,’ those from the University of Texas believe you ‘don’t ever stop to smell what shit you’re shoveling,’ and our associates at the University of Michigan have begun simply saying ‘huh?’ when confronted with new data on what the fuck you’re saying. Basically, everyone unfortunate enough to be made aware of you holds the unanimous belief that you should shut the hell up.” In a related report, researchers have confirmed you have absolutely no idea what the fuck you’re doing.",

         "Set Ronan Mullen Free By Registering To Vote In Seanad Elections Share:\n\nNOW is your chance to set Ronan Mullen free by registering for the Seanad elections. If you attended NUI you can register HERE.\n\nSources close but not too close to Mullen have confirmed that he no longer wishes to accept taxpayers money in the form of his €66,940 Seanad salary and if you register HERE by the end of today, the 26th of February, you can set him free by giving him the ultimate gift of voting for someone else.\n\n“I know he looks like he enjoys saying mental health isn’t a real thing, how gay people shouldn’t be allowed to marry and encouraging people to harass women, he considers destined for Hell, as they enter hospitals to obtain an abortion but it takes its toll. Please, set him free,” confirmed one increasingly distant source.\n\nToo proud to outright ask NUI graduates to register HERE and oust him as a Senator, Mullen is facing the possibility of yet more years of consistently opposing things, caging himself in an attritional process which risks eroding away at his very soul.\n\n“Ronan is a beautiful bird, and like all beautiful birds he is desperate to fly. We can help him fly away by voting for someone else in the Seanad elections but if we don’t we’re sentencing Ronan to years of sounding like a terrible human being by asserting women would fake suicidal tendencies just to get an abortion,” added the source.\n\n“You don’t honestly think he wants to do this, do you? It’s just people keep voting him in, you can end his misery by registering HERE,” explained the source, someone how having the ability to highlight a web link to a website.",

         "Hey Bill Nye! Is \"We Are Living in a Computer Simulation\" a Testable Hypothesis?",
         "Sign up for the Smarter Faster newsletter A weekly newsletter featuring the biggest ideas from the smartest people Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\n\nAre we living in a holographic simulation created by a supercomputer beyond our comprehension? That question occurs again and again in science fiction, perhaps most notably in The Matrix, a film in which unreality is so pristine that no one notices the truth. That we are all actually, truly living in such a matrix seems laughable until you consider the advances made by video games in the last few decades.\n\nNot long ago, all we had was pong: two rectangles and a circle. Today we have virtual reality consoles which are edging toward an experience indistinguishable from reality, or at least what we think of as reality. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX cofounder, was recently asked this question: Is it possible that the world as we know it is just a simulation made by someone else?\n\nHis response is perhaps startling, saying that the chances of this reality being a “base” reality are “one in billions.” To make matters even more confusing, humans are increasingly turning to virtual reality devices to escape this “reality.” Thorsten Wiedemann, for example, spent forty-eight hours wearing his Oculus Rift device, proving it is possible to live within a virtual reality at least for a short time.\n\nWhen we asked Bill Nye the Science Guy if he thinks we are living in a computer-generated simulation, he turned to some basic scientific principles to justify his answer. Science ultimately demands testable, repeatable hypotheses to proceed, but how do you test whether we are living in a computer simulation or not? There just doesn’t seem to be a way.\n\nThere is every possibility that this is a hyper-real version of The Sims, and we wouldn’t know. If we had never seen the outside world, there’s no reason we would know it exists, that we’re missing it. So if we as a people had only ever existed in this hyper real video game, we wouldn’t know it was all just a game.\n\nThat is why it is “unknowable,” according to Bill Nye. If we were in a video game, human minds would not be able to detect the outside world until “something goes wrong,” i.e. a glitch in the matrix. Still, Nye wishes luck to anyone wanting to design such an experiment. It might take some time, but perhaps could be done…",

Hoo-Ee, Supper’s On!’ Says Sonny Perdue\n\nBONAIRE, GA—In an effort to summon all 325 million citizens in from the fields for supper time, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue rang the nationwide dinner bell Wednesday evening right at 6 p.m. for y’all to get in here. “Hoo-ee, hoo-ee! Come on in! Get it while it’s hot!” shouted Perdue, making sure to ring it loud enough for all the nation’s citizenry who were playing outside to hear it so they could hurry along now before the food gets cold. “Up, up, up, take your shoes off before you come into your house, and wash those hands real good! I worked hard on this beef for y’all, and I won’t have you waiting until it gets cold. And I better not catch you trying to sneak any of that rhubarb pie before you’ve finished your plate!” At press time, Perdue was scolding tens of millions of Americans for not scrubbing under their nails before coming to the table.",

Julio, 1,230 miles southeast of Hilo, is currently forecast to affect Hawaiian Islands as early as Sunday morning.\n\nIselle, still a Category 1 storm, is about 245 miles southeast of Hilo, moving at 17 mph. It measures 80-mph winds with stronger gusts. Radar imaging shows Iselle's outer bands are near the coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaimea on Hawaii Island experienced a 4.5 magnitude earthquake this morning. At 6:24 a.m. Thursday, the quake shook the island, its epicenter located about 7 miles out from the northern tip of the Big Island.

Kauai County is now under a tropical storm watch. A hurricane warning continues for Hawaii Island.\n\nUPDATE, Aug. 6, 3:20 p.m. HST: Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation before Hurricanes Iselle and Julio make landfall. It includes all islands in the state, activates the Major Disaster Fund for disaster relief, and allows access to emergency resources at state and federal levels. According to the proclamation, the emergency relief period will last through August 15.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaui County Mayor Alan Arakawa declared a state of emergency for the county, which includes Lanai, Molokai, Maui, Kahoolawe and Molokini, effective 11:10 a.m. this morning and extending until September 5, if needed.

As of 7:00 a.m. HST on Wednesday, Iselle was about 695 miles east-southeast of Hilo, moving west-northwest at 15 mph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA tropical storm watch is in effect for Oahu, Maui County (which includes Maui, Lanai and Molokai), and Hawaii Island.\n\n--\n\nHawaii is about to experience two very rare, back-to-back storms.\n\nThe National Weather Service Central Pacific Hurricane Center (NWSCPH) is monitoring two large storms as they approach the Hawaiian islands. Hurricane Iselle is expected to reach Hawaii Island on Thursday afternoon and continue along the island chain through the weekend, and tropical storm Julio is expected to follow along the same path two or three days behind.\n\nIt's being called an extremely rare and unprecedented event. The Weather Channel’s lead meteorologist Kevin Roth wrote that “In 75 years of reliable data you only have one case where [tropical storms] were even 10 days apart,” referring to a time in 1982 when two weaker tropical storms and depressions hit Hawaii.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselle is classified as a category 2 hurricane right now but is expected to weaken into a tropical storm due to cooler waters and increased wind shear around the islands.\n\nBelow, everything we know about these rare tropical storms.\n\nWhere are they headed?\n\nIselle is currently a little less than 970 miles away from main Hawaiian islands, moving westward in the tradewind flow towards Hawaii at 13 mph. Iselle’s center is expected to cross Hawaii's Big Island Thursday night and continue on a trajectory south of (but still affecting) the other main islands, including Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Kauai.\n\nTropical storm Julio, which is trailing Iselle and was 905 miles east of Hilo on the Big Island as of Tuesday evening, is expected to become a hurricane by Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow strong are they and what will happen?\n\nIselle is predicted to remain a hurricane through Wednesday before weakening into a tropical storm, which could have wind speeds between 39 and 73 mph. Iselle is also predicted to have winds in the 45-55 mph range, with gusts as strong as 65 mph or more, especially on mountain ridges.\n\nHawaii's Big Island, where the storms are expected to hit first, was under a tropical storm watch beginning Tuesday evening, which means “tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area within 48 hours.” Because of the warmer water outside the Big Island, Iselle’s speed, which was at 13 mph on Tuesday and is expected to increase, is too fast for the warmth to strengthen Iselle back into a hurricane, Lau said in a press conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA flash flood watch is issued for all islands starting at 4 a.m., Thursday, through 6 a.m., Friday. Otherwise, there are no other watches or warnings related to Iselle, but that could change suddenly and with little notice.\n\nMain threats include heavy rains with area flash flooding and coastal inundations through Friday, with tropical storm-force winds: 45 to 55 mph and gusts of up to 65 mph.\n\n8/5 11a HST: Tropical storm watch has been issued for the Big Island of #Hawaii due to #Iselle http://t.co/hVMu6PTz9D pic.twitter.com/Sbjh3AGO7M — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) August 5, 2014\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are Hawaii residents doing now?\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Tuesday, NWSCPH, which is based in Honolulu, has taken over forecast responsibility for Iselle and Julio from the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\nDrivers are beginning to line up at area gas stations, as well as hit stores such as Costco and Wal-Mart for comestibles and toiletries. Things they’re buying include Spam, toilet paper, bottled water, baby supplies, and rice.\n\nHawaiian Airlines will waive reservation change fees and differences in fares for any customer changing travel plans on August 7 or 8 due to Iselle and Julio, effective immediately. The change must be done by Hawaiian Airlines personnel prior to the departure time of your original flight. There’s some fine print, so click here for more information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLines are crazy at Costco Iwilei right now.

         "UT/TT Poll: Texas voters feeling high anxiety over election security",
         "Voters in the party that has not lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994 are most likely to say that elections are fraught with criminality, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.\n\nThe findings echo Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s “rigged election” theme and rising apprehension over foreign or criminal hackers.\n\nRepublicans, who have won every statewide election in Texas for the past two decades, were more likely than independents and much more likely than Democrats to say that “people voting who are not eligible” will be an “extremely serious” or “somewhat serious” problem in this year’s elections.\n\nNine of 10 Republicans said ineligible voters voting would be a serious problem, 69 percent of independents said so and only 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Three-quarters of the Democrats rated the problem “not too serious” or “not serious at all.”\n\nAmong the Republican voters, 70 percent ranked the problem as “extremely serious.”\n\n“Wow,” said Daron Shaw, co-director of the poll and a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, after looking over the results. “To me, it’s an indication of how unhappy people are with the system, how deeply they believe it is corrupt and incompetent.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe same pattern held true when they were asked about people voting multiple times. Overwhelming numbers of Republican likely voters — 83 percent — said that will be a serious problem this year. Among independent voters, 61 percent agreed with that, but only 24 percent of Democrats think multiple voting will be a serious problem.\n\n“This is one of these showcase results where you have to ask the chicken-and-egg question about Republican attitudes in Texas and what Donald Trump seems to have wrought — but might just be plugging into,” said Jim Henson, who heads the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin and co-directs the poll. “Republicans nationally, but also in Texas, have been stoking worries about the election process in the absence of any systematic evidence of any real problems.”\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe party lines blur a bit when voters are asked about “votes being counted inaccurately.” Three quarters of self-identified Republican and independent voters think that will be a serious concern this year, and 45 percent of Democrats agree with them.\n\nAnd the lines fade more when it comes to “voting machines being hacked into by a foreign government or other bad actor.” That one got a serious ranking from 66 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of independents and 55 percent of Democrats.\n\nEmily Albracht\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 14 to Oct. 23 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points. Among likely voters — those who said either that they are certain to vote or that they have voted in “every” recent election — the margin of error is +/- 3.16 percentage points (n=959). Numbers in charts might not add up to 100 percent because of rounding.\n\nThis is one of several stories on the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. Yesterday: The race for president. Also today: What Texas voters think about various state and federal officeholders and institutions.\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.

         "Phil Murphy beats Kim Guadagno to succeed Christie as N.J. governor",
         "TRENTON -- Phil Murphy, a former Wall Street executive and diplomat with no previous elected experience but deep pockets and strong ties to the Democratic Party, easily defeated Republican Kim Guadagno Tuesday to succeed Chris Christie as New Jersey's governor.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, with 99 percent of districts reporting, Murphy led Guadagno by about 13 percentage points -- 55.4 percent to 42.5 percent, according to the Associated Press. Murphy was ahead by nearly 250,000 voters -- 1.12 million to 859,000.\n\nCNN, ABC, and NBC projected Murphy the victory around 8 p.m. Tuesday, almost immediately after the polls closed. The projection was based on exit polling and was an indicator the race would not be close.\n\nMurphy's victory over Guadagno, Christie's lieutenant governor, will usher in a new era of Democratic rule in the Garden State after eight years of Christie, a once-popular Republican who saw his approval rating plummet to historic lows in recent years. Christie was prohibited by state law from running for a third consecutive term.\n\nMurphy, 60, will become the first Democrat in the governor's office since Jon Corzine, another former Goldman Sachs executive who spent millions of his own money to win the seat in 2005 but lost re-election to Christie in 2009.\n\nWhen Murphy is sworn in as the state's 56th governor Jan. 16, Democrats will likely control both the governor's office and the state Legislature for the first time since Corzine's four-year term.\n\nAll legislative races have not been called yet, but Democrats will at least hold -- if not expand -- their control of both the state Senate and Assembly.\n\n\"Tonight, we declare the days of division over,\" Murphy said during his victory speech in Asbury Park. \"We will move forward together. ... We have each other's backs.\"\n\nMurphy -- a former U.S. ambassador to Germany -- will take over arguably the most powerful governor's seat in the nation, with the ability to line-item veto bills and the state budget and appoint state officials who are elected in other states.\n\nHe has promised to push New Jersey in a progressive direction, vowing to legalize and tax marijuana, institute a $15 minimum wage, tighten the state's already strict gun-control laws, and ramp up funding for education, public-worker pensions, and transportation, while protecting undocumented immigrants and fighting the agenda of President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nMurphy said Tuesday night that he will push back against \"the mean winds\" blowing out of Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This is one of the first major elections since Donald Trump was elected,\" he said. \"Tonight, New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation: We are better than this.\"\n\nMurphy will also bring a much different personality to the governor's office than Christie did. Whereas Christie made national headlines for his brash, often combative attitude, Murphy is more low-key and prone to smiling even when challenged.\n\nMurphy inherits a state with signifiant problems -- including the highest property taxes in the country, a troubled transportation system, and a public-worker pension system deeply in debt.\n\nFor Guadagno, the loss brings an end to her eight-year run in Trenton. With her association to Christie hanging on her like an albatross, Guadagno trailed Murphy by double digits in every poll and had a 3-to-1 fundraising disadvantage in a state where registered Democrats outnumber register Republicans by about 880,000.\n\nGuadagno, who was vying to become only the second woman governor in state history, lost even though she had cut into Murphy's lead in polls with an aggressive push before Election Day.\n\nGuadagno said during her concession speech that her campaign \"made the best case possible.\"\n\n\"We were fighting for our families and we will continue that fight for lower taxes and a safer New Jersey,\" she told the crowd in Aberdeen. \"This is not the end. ... We may have lost the battle, but we will win this war in the long run.\"\n\nNew Jersey was one of only two states in the U.S. with a governor's election Tuesday, along with Virginia.\n\nAnd though voters in the blue state were getting to choose Christie's replacement a year after Trump's election, the race largely inspired apathy among Jerseyans. Up until last week, polls showed more than half of likely voters knew little about Guadagno or Murphy.\n\nBut a Democrat -- Ralph Northam -- also won Virginia's race. And political experts Tuesday were already framing both elections as a repudiation of Trump's policies.\n\nTuesday's victory caps an unexpected journey to the Statehouse for Murphy, a Boston area native who was little known in the state before entering this race last year.\n\nMurphy gobbled up support from the Democratic Party chairs in key north Jersey counties to become the front-runner for the party's nomination, pushing aside expected candidates like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester.\n\nHe then spent $16 million of his own fortune en route to handily beating five primary opponents to snag the Democratic nomination.\n\nMurphy repeatedly linked Guadagno to Christie and promised to boost the state's economy, saying his time at Goldman Sachs taught him how to create jobs.\n\nGuadagno repeatedly linked Murphy to Corzine, calling him an out-of-touch multimillionaire liberal who would raise taxes in the state.\n\nMurphy plans to increase spending by $1.3 billion on education, pensions, and transportation by hiking taxes on wealthy residents, closing corporate tax loopholes, and taxing legal pot. He says the hikes would spare the middle class.\n\nHe also proposes instituting a state-run bank to help rev the economy.\n\nMurphy vows to battle Trump's policies in a diverse state where the president is deeply unpopular. He said during a debate that he would even consider making New Jersey a \"sanctuary state\" to protect some undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nGuadagno pounced on that, painting Murphy as being too soft on crime and releasing a controversial television ad that suggested he would even protect \"deranged murderers\" like Jose Carranza, an undocumented immigrant from Peru who was convicted of killing thee teens in Newark in 2007.\n\nMurphy and his supporters denounced the commercial as racist and deceitful. Visiting Edison to stump for Murphy, former Vice President Joe Biden called it \"the return of Willie Horton\" -- a reference to the infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race.\n\nPolitical experts said Guadagno appeared to be borrowing a page from Trump's far-right playbook to appeal to the GOP base in what was predicted to be a race with a record-low voter turnout.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nPolls showed that Guadagno was hurt by her connection to Christie, a one-time national Republican star and presidential contender whose approval ratings have dropped by nearly 50 percentage points over the last few years.\n\nAfter voting in Mendham on Tuesday morning, Christie rejected the idea that this race was a referendum on his two terms as governor.\n\n\"This is not an election about me,\" Christie said. \"I had my referendum. My referendum was four years ago.\"\n\nChristie said he voted for @KimGuadagnoNJ, and that he doesn't think 2017 is a referendum on his tenure pic.twitter.com/aBMOPMYVWq — Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017\n\nNew Jerseyans often pinball between electing Republicans and Democrats for governor. No Democratic governor has won re-election since Brendan Byrne did 40 years ago, in 1977.\n\nMurphy overcame his ties to Goldman Sachs, which had become a target of derision during last year's presidential race. He spent 23 years at the Wall Street firm, managing its Asian and German offices.\n\nHe and his wife, Tammy Murphy, donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party both locally and national over the years and he served as the finance chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2006 to 2009.\n\nPresident Barack Obama then chose Murphy to become America's ambassador to Germany, a post Murphy held until 2013.\n\nMurphy was bolstered over the last two months by campaign visits from a string of big-name Democrats -- including Obama, Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Al Gore. Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi, his friend and neighbor, also performed at a Murphy rally two days before Election Day.\n\nMurphy also had the support of dozens of labor unions, including the New Jersey Education Association and the Communication Workers of America.\n\nMurphy's lieutenant governor will be Sheila Oliver, a veteran member of the state Assembly from Essex County who was the first black woman to serve as Assembly speaker in state history.\n\nOliver also won re-election to her Assembly seat on Tuesday. But under state law, she will have to give up that post to serve as lieutenant governor.\n\nNJ Advance Media staff writers Matt Arco and Claude Brodesser-Akner contributed to this report.\n\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.

         "Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks\n\nAlthough the past few years have been an incredibly powerful time for women’s rights, feminism has just suffered a pretty crushing setback: Tragically, this woman sucks.\n\nDevastating. This is not good news for the feminist cause.\n\nThe notion that all women are powerful queens who deserve the world sadly doesn’t even come close to applying to 28-year-old Sarah Baylor, whose boring hobbies, grating personality traits, and overall lack of positive attributes prove that some women can (and do) absolutely suck. Between the below-average work she does at her totally inconsequential job, the meandering anecdotes about owning a ferret she foists on unsuspecting acquaintances, and the fact that she honestly smells kind of bad, Sarah unfortunately does not bring a single thing to the table that would compel someone to fight for women’s rights on her behalf. It’s tough to imagine anyone getting behind a movement intended to empower someone as unpleasant to be around as this god-awful woman.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s difficult to extend any sisterly support to someone who sucks this much ass.\n\nThere’s no telling how far Sarah will set back the feminist cause over the course of her life, but her apparent commitment to using her bad personality to totally blow every personal and professional opportunity that comes her way suggests that she will continue giving women a bad name for the foreseeable future. Had Sojourner Truth known that one day a woman like Sarah would go through life without ever doing anything even marginally impressive—seriously, not even winning some kind of bogus “citizenship” award in elementary school—would she have bothered to fight for women’s rights in the first place? It’s hard to say.\n\nYikes. We can only imagine what kind of damage Sarah already done to feminism just by being her selfish, slovenly, and frankly horrible self. Here’s hoping the feminist agenda finds a way to prevail despite such an awful blight on the movement.",

         "In the last 24 hours, four federal courts have objected to Trump’s actions",
         "Last night, a Federal District court issued an emergency stay on deportations for passengers affected by President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. Since that first decision, three other courts have issued their own rulings, putting a halt to deportations for those detained at airports across the country.\n\nDespite the rulings, there appears to be some uncertainty surrounding the judicial orders. The New York Post reports that some customs agents have ignored the orders, and have not allowed access to detainees. We’ll update this report as more information becomes available.\n\nTrump’s team now appears to be tweaking the executive order in response to widespread protests. Late on Sunday night, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a waiver that allows people holding green cards or with valid permanent residence in the United States to enter the country. In a statement published on the DHS’ site, Kelly said that “in applying the provisions of the president’s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.” The statement says that “absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”\n\nHere’s where we stand:\n\nNew York City\n\nFederal Judge Ann Donnelly noted in her decision that that “there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject,” impacted by the order. The order was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a pair of Iraqi refugees who had been detained.\n\nThe order only applies to individuals who had been detained at airports around the country: that is, people who had come from one of the nations that were banned in the executive order.\n\nThe decision has no impact on the rest of the order, which bans citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya from entering the United States for the next 90 days, bans refugees from those countries for 120 days, and bans refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nAlexandria, Virginia\n\nFederal Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a ruling last night as well for 50 to 60 individuals from the affected countries who are Lawful Permanent Residents. According to petitioners, the people detained were denied access to lawyers, and that removing them from the country would result in “irreparable harm.”\n\nBrinkema agreed, ordering that the detained individuals be granted access to legal counsel, and forbid them from being deported for the next seven days.\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nIn Seattle, members of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed for an Emergency Stay of Removal on behalf of two individuals, saying that the detentions were illegal. District Court Judge Thomas Thomas S. Zilly ordered the stay of removal, “pending further order of the court.” He also set a hearing for Friday, February 3rd to determine whether or not to lift the stay.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nFinally, petitioners filed a petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive relief with the federal court overnight in Boston, Massachusetts. US District Judge Allison D. Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Gail Dein found that the detention and removal of “the petitioners and others similarly situated would violate their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection as guaranteed by the United States Constitution,” and that should the detained individuals be removed from the US, they would likely “suffer irreparable harm.”\n\nThe judges ordered that the Department of Homeland Security would be required to limit “secondary screening to comply with the regulations and statutes in effect prior to the Executive Order,” were not permitted to “detain or remove” approved refugees, anyone who held a valid Visa, green card holders, and other individuals “who, absent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.” The ruling stipulated that the United States Marshall of Massachusetts would be served with the order and required to enforce it, and that Border Patrol and Customs should notify airlines arriving at Boston’s Logan Airport of the order and that individuals on the flights would not be detained or deported. The judges noted that this ruling would remain in effect for seven days, with another hearing scheduled before then.\n\nThe four rulings represent a setback for the Trump administration, which was acting on campaign promises to halt the flow of refugees and immigrants to the United States, and were accompanied by widespread protests last night, with more planned in the coming days.\n\nFollowing the rulings, the American Civil Liberties Union has promised to continue to fight against the executive orders. “This is merely the first skirmish in a long battle to vigorously defend the Bill of Rights from the authoritarian designs of the Trump administration.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement this morning that it would “comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump’s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.”\n\nThis morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that the country needed extreme vetting, and pointed to immigration in Europe. He also defended his administration decision to provide preferential treatment to minority Christians attempting to enter the United States, noting that they were “executed in large numbers.”\n\nThis morning, The New York Times reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said that green card holders will be permitted to enter the country, but that they would have “discretionary authority” to detain and question individuals.\n\nUpdated to add information from The New York Times and details of John Kelly’s statement.\n\nTrump’s ‘Muslim ban’ won’t help security",

         "Health officials find first cases of new superbug in US",
         "Just five months after federal health officials asked hospitals and physicians to be on the lookout for an often-fatal, antibiotic-resistant fungus called Candida auris, 13 cases have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. It is the first time that the fungus, which is easily misidentified in lab tests as a more common candida yeast infection, has been found in the US, and four of the first seven patients with it have died.\n\n“We need to act now to better understand, contain and stop the spread of this drug-resistant fungus,” the CDC’s director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said in a statement. “This is an emerging threat, and we need to protect vulnerable patients and others.”\n\nC. auris’s emergence and apparent global spread — it was first identified in Japan in 2009 and since then has been found in a dozen countries on four continents — put the pathogen on the ever-growing list of superbugs, disease-causing microbes that are resistant to many and, in some cases, all antibiotics.\n\nRead more: Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nMore From Stat News Loopholes on animal antibiotics may undermine battle against superbugs\n\nThe first seven cases, which are described in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, occurred in New York, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey in 2013 (one case), 2015 (one case), and this year (five cases). The older cases were identified through a review of patients’ lab records conducted after the CDC sent its clinical alert in June. All seven of the patients had been hospitalized for cancer, respiratory failure, or other serious condition, so it is not clear if C. auris contributed to the deaths of four of them, the CDC said.\n\nThe other six cases came to the CDC’s attention after August.\n\nFive of the first seven cases had not been flagged as C. auris at the time the patients were hospitalized, underlining the difficulty of identifying the fungus. Five were also resistant to the common antifungal drug fluconazole (sold as Diflucan). One was resistant to amphotericin B, an antifungal usually saved for serious infections, and one to echinocandins, a newer class of antifungals touted as being effective against Candida.\n\nAlthough C. auris strains from other countries have been found to be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs, none of the US cases was.\n\nThe global spread of C. auris has had public health officials on alert for imported cases, but all of the US cases seem to have been contracted domestically. When scientists sequenced the genomes of C. auris in the first seven cases, they found that they were related to strains from South Asia and South America. Since none of the patients had traveled to those areas or were known to have been in contact with anyone from there, CDC scientists concluded that they had acquired the infections locally.\n\n“It appears that C. auris arrived in the United States only in the past few years,” Dr. Tom Chiller, who leads CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch, said in a statement. “We’re working hard with partners to better understand this fungus and how it spreads.”\n\nA partial answer: easily. After one of the Illinois patients was hospitalized for an unrelated illness, researchers found C. auris in his mattress, bedside table, bed rail, chair, and windowsill.\n\nMore evidence of how easy C. auris is spread, at least in hospitals: The genome sequencing showed that the two patients treated in the same New Jersey hospital at the same time had nearly identical strains; the genome sequences of the C. auris infecting the two Illinois patients, also treated at the same hospital at the same time, were also nearly identical to one another. “These findings suggest that C. auris could be spread in healthcare settings,” the CDC said.\n\nAlthough 60 percent of people with C. auris infections outside the US have died, the CDC said, that figure is based on a small number of patients, many of whom had other severe illnesses, making it unclear how serious the infection on its own might be.",

         "Resistance Win: When One Of Her Students Wore A MAGA Hat To Class, This Incredible Teacher Stopped Having Sex With Him After School\n\nFair warning to all you Drumpf lovers out there: You might want to keep scrolling past this story, because a Resistance smackdown this epic may be too much for you to handle: A student in this Toledo, OH high school wore a MAGA hat to class, and his incredible teacher’s amazing response was to completely stop having sex with him every day after school.\n\nAbsolutely perfect. Now THIS is how you secure a W for the right side of history!\n\nAs soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls. Yep, this teacher is the kind of heroic lover of freedom who simply refuses to have an affair with any student of hers who supports Trump’s despicable administration.\n\nHow’s that burn feel, Drumpf lovers??\n\nSo. Epic. It’s not always easy to take a stand in a world where bigotry of all kinds has become the norm since Treasonous Trump took the reins, so it’s absolutely thrilling when someone like Amanda Higgins claps back by telling her Trump-supporting student that she’ll no longer be having sex with him in her car after he’s done with wrestling practice. That 15-year-old MAGA shithead just found out the hard way that actions have consequences.\n\nMs. Higgins, we salute you! The Resistance believes that you deserve to be having sex with a student who believes in freedom and equality for all—not a hateful and bigoted Trump supporter like Eric. Let this be a warning shot to all you Dump lovers out there: If you support this corrupt administration, your days are as numbered as the president’s, because there are plenty more badass takedowns like this on the horizon!",

         "NEW YORK—In a move touted as a major victory for the rights of New Yorker public transportation passengers who are this close to fucking losing it, the Metropolitan Transit Authority unveiled a new designated seating system Friday designed to accommodate commuters who seem to be just about to snap. “For too many years, the New York City MTA has failed to meet the needs of scowling riders repeatedly muttering ‘Fuck this shit’ under their breath, but today, we’re excited to announce that individuals about to blow a fuse will now be offered seats where they can have a second of goddamn peace,” said spokesman Aaron Donovan, adding that the initiative would cater to the roughly 1.7 million city residents who find themselves on the brink of daily violent meltdowns by adding a minimum of four seating options by the entrance of each subway car, rail car, and bus. “Those seats reserved for customers one bad moment away from flipping their wig at any second will have signage indicating them as such. Those who are clearly going through some serious shit and wearing an expression conveying ‘Not today’ have long been overlooked, so, as always, offer your seat to the critically cranked-up when at all possible.” Shortly after their introduction, thousands of transit passengers across New York City were seen going totally fucking apeshit upon discovering the priority seats already occupied.",

         "One Video Game Company Has Murky Ties To Trump’s Lawyer And Russian Payments",
         "Photo: Alexey Filippov (Host Photo Agency via Getty Images)\n\nRobert Mueller’s investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken all sorts of strange turns over the past year and a half, but this might be one of the strangest: It turns out that Trump’s lawyer has a circuitous connection to the video game company behind games like H1Z1 and Everquest.\n\n\n\nLast night, word came out that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, had received $500,000 in payments from a U.S. investment firm connected to a Russian oligarch named Viktor Vekselberg. That firm, Columbus Nova, has its fingers in a lot of pots. In January 2016, months before a wrestler’s lawsuit led to Kotaku’s former parent company Gawker Media getting purchased by Univision, Columbus Nova put a minority investment into Gawker. And in 2015, it was reported that Columbus Nova purchased Sony Online Entertainment, the San Diego, CA-based studio behind dozens of well-received video games. We knew that because both companies announced it together, with a press release declaring, “Columbus Nova acquires Sony Online Entertainment.” Alongside the move, the company said it would be changing its name to Daybreak.\n\n\n\nNow, Daybreak is rewriting history. Over the past few weeks, as the studio laid off staff amidst a declining audience for H1Z1, Daybreak has distanced itself from Columbus Nova, deleting said press release from its website and telling reporters that it had not actually been purchased by the investment firm, but in fact by businessman Jason Epstein. “Daybreak Game Company has no affiliation with Columbus Nova,” the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement on April 25. “Jason Epstein purchased Daybreak (then SOE) from Sony in February 2015. Mr. Epstein was a senior partner at Columbus Nova at the time he acquired the company. He left Columbus Nova in 2017 and remains the primary shareholder of Daybreak.”\n\nThat statement contradicts much of the company’s past three years, however. Daybreak described Columbus Nova as its parent company in its 2015 user privacy policy, as well as in a press release by Fenwick and West, the law firm that represented SOE in the acquisition. A spokesperson for Daybreak Games would not comment on how the press release could have been so misleading and why no subsequent statements that Columbus Nova owned the company were never corrected before now. Instead, Daybreak elaborated on its initial statement in a forum post, saying it was well aware of past statements made about the company’s ownership but that Epstein had been the majority owner since the acquisition. Daybreak’s spokespeople added that recent changes to the company’s website and third-party communications were simply part of a new effort to set the record straight.\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Daybreakgames.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuestions over Daybreak’s relationship to Columbus Nova began to bubble up in April, when the website MassivelyOP pointed out that the U.S. government had frozen some of Viktor Vekselberg’s assets, which it believed raised questions about the future of games like Everquest II. Vekselberg, a Russian businessman whose net worth in 2015 was reportedly $13.5 billion, is the owner of a company called Renova Group. Until this week, it was widely reported and believed that Columbus Nova was a subsidiary of Renova Group—something that Columbus Nova now denies. Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, has been the CEO of Columbus Nova since 2000 according to his bio on the investment firm’s website, a page which was removed sometime in the last 24 hours. And yesterday, Columbus Nova put out a statement denying that it was owned by Renova Group. “Throughout its existence, Columbus Nova has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients,” the statement reads. “Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group.”\n\n\n\nBoth Vekselberg and Intrater have donated to Trump and both attended his inauguration, according to The New York Times, which also reports that both men have since been interviewed by special prosecutor Bob Mueller’s office, the team in charge of investigating Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nSo here we are. Until April, everyone had believed that Columbus Nova owned Daybreak, which Daybreak now denies. Until this week, everyone had believed that Renova Group owned Columbus Nova—SEC filings even showed as much—which Columbus Nova now denies. And yesterday, news broke that Trump’s lawyer had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late April, as Daybreak was telling press that it was not actually owned by Columbus Nova, the game studio was also laying off staff. Laura Naviaux Sturr, chief publishing officer at Daybreak following the acquisition, left the company on April 25. A day later, many designers and programmers at Daybreak announced on Twitter that they had been let go.\n\nOne of the people laid off, an employee who had been at the company for over six years and asked not to be named, told Kotaku in an email that rumors of the layoffs had been circulating around the office for months and that some people had already cleared out their desks ahead of the official announcement. The employee, who was in a management role, said Epstein owning the company came as a surprise. “Most of us were just as confused by the statement as everyone else was,” they said. “I guess a select few people knew we weren’t actually owned by Columbus Nova, but they were definitely in the minority.”\n\nScreenshot: Daybreak Games (H1Z1)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former creative lead on Planetside 2, who also wished to remain anonymous, shared a similar story. “My understanding at the time was that we were being added to a holding company for Russian investments in tech which was run by Jason,” they told Kotaku. “There was an all-hands meeting shortly before I left where Jason introduced himself, explained who Columbus Nova and Renova were.” While their understanding was that Jason ran Columbus Nova, but was not acquiring the studio himself, they say the distinction was never really made explicit one way or the other.\n\n\n\nThat person left the company shortly after it was sold and after a large round of layoffs. Months later, studio president John Smedley, who had founded the company, left as well. (In the original press release about the sale, Smedley was attributed to the quote: “We are excited to join Columbus Nova’s impressive roster of companies.” Smedley did not respond to a request for comment.) He was replaced by Ji Ham, a vice president at Columbus Nova.\n\n\n\nAnd what of Columbus Nova’s ties to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and his company, Renova? Despite Columbus Nova’s denials, the web is full of bread crumbs linking the two companies. For example, while Jason Epstein’s profile on the Columbus Nova MB website no longer exists, an archived version of what appeared in September of 2016 lists him as a managing partner of Renova US Management, the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur own connections to Columbus Nova are also tied to Renova. For a period of time between January of 2016 and when Univision bought Gawker the following August, Jason Epstein was given a seat on Gawker’s board of directors. “My understanding at the time of the Columbus Nova investment in Gawker Media in January 2016 was that Columbus Nova was ultimately controlled by Viktor Vekselberg,” John Cook, who was then executive editor of Gawker Media, told me today. Columbus Nova was commonly understood to be the U.S. operating arm of the Russian conglomerate and ultimately owned by Vekselberg, something reiterated in multiple news reports at the time. At the same time, Cook said neither Vekselberg nor anyone at Columbus Nova attempted to exercise any influence over editorial matters during that time.\n\n\n\nMorale at Daybreak remains low, according to the source who was laid off from the studio two weeks ago. They told me that, based on conversations with people still at Daybreak, the atmosphere is grim, despite ongoing company-wide meetings to try and allay people’s concerns about the future of the company. As Daybreak prepares for the PS4 release of H1Z1, whose open beta will launch on May 22, its murky ties to Trump and the Russian investigation cannot be of much comfort.\n\n\n\nUpdate - 5:57pm: Updated the language in the second paragraph to clarify that while Columbus Nova’s acquisition of Daybreak was noted in a press release, it was otherwise not confirmed.",

         "Former stripper who filmed lovers seeks pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens",
         "CLAYTON • A former law student and male stripper prosecuted for invasion of privacy for secretly filming sex partners two decades ago is now seeking a pardon from Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, indicted under the same criminal statute last week.\n\nA letter sent Sunday to a lawyer for Greitens cites Greitens’ own motion to dismiss his case and his “published position on this statute,” and requests that the lawyer forward the request.\n\nThe pardon application was submitted to former Gov. Jay Nixon in 2011. He did not grant it or reject it, leaving it pending, the letter says.\n\nThe pardon request, sent by lawyer Albert Watkins, is on behalf of Paul Henreid, of Walnut Creek, Calif., who is a documentary filmmaker and lawyer.\n\nWatkins, who has never shied from publicity or controversy, said in a news release that it would be “mighty hypocritical” for Greitens to reject the request given Greitens’ dismissal motion.\n\n“What’s good for the governor should be good for the gander,” Watkins said.\n\nWatkins also represents the ex-husband of the woman with whom Greitens had an affair. Thursday’s indictment claims Greitens photographed her nude or partially nude without her consent and then transmitted that photograph in some unspecified way.\n\nThe governor’s motion to dismiss does not challenge the existence of a photo, but says the woman had no expectation of privacy, which is a requirement of the invasion of privacy statute, during a consensual sexual encounter.\n\nAudio: Woman describes encounter with Greitens A man says he recorded his then-wife describing an encounter with Eric Greitens in March 2015. The recording, obtained by the Post-Dispatch, w…\n\nIn a taped conversation with her husband, the woman said the governor took the photo without her consent during a consensual sexual encounter, then threatened to release it if she mentioned his name. Greitens has denied blackmailing the woman.\n\nThe scandal has prompted calls for Greitens’ resignation, as well as an independent investigation by legislators.\n\nHis lawyers lashed out at the indictment, and Greitens, a Republican, called it a “misguided political decision” by a “reckless liberal prosecutor” in a statement.\n\nLovers secretly filmed\n\nHenreid, then Paul Henroid, pleaded guilty to invasion of privacy in 1999 after he was caught filming multiple lovers without their knowledge.\n\nOne was a co-worker at the Metro East nightclub where Henroid “moonlighted as an exotic dancer,” the pardon application says. The filming was outed in 1997 by Henroid’s friend, who was also a rival for the woman’s affections, the application says.\n\nHenroid was indicted in 1998 on four counts: invasion of privacy, promoting child pornography, possession of child porn and child abuse. The child porn and abuse charges came because she was 17 at the time of the filming. Although she could legally consent to sex, it was illegal to film her fully or partially nude, the pardon application says.\n\nHenroid’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the invasion of privacy statute as unconstitutionally vague and, foreshadowing Greitens’ own challenge 20 years later, as aimed at “peeping Toms,” not someone engaged in consensual sex, the application says. Henroid then pleaded guilty to the invasion of privacy charge as part of a deal that resulted in the dismissal of the other charges.\n\nHe expected a type of probation that would erase the conviction from the public record, but the judge disagreed. She sentenced him to 30 days of shock time and left him with a conviction, saying he shouldn’t be allowed to be a lawyer “because you have shown no regard for that law or the rights of others,” according to a transcript of the hearing. He was ordered to spend the 30 nights in jail but was allowed out during the day to work.\n\nHenreid is considering running for public office, the application says. He admits that his actions were “deceitful and immoral,” but says the punishment he has suffered and continues to suffer “is unwarranted based on the facts of this case.”\n\nGreitens’ lawyers couldn’t be immediately reached for comment Sunday.",

         "‘When I’m Onstage Performing, There Can Be Up To A Dozen Confused Birds Flapping Around The Ceiling And I Hardly Notice Them At All’: 5 Questions With Janelle Monáe\n\nJanelle Monáe first made her mark in the music world in 2010 with her critically acclaimed debut album, The ArchAndroid, and her incredible artistry and vision have garnered six Grammy nominations since. Monáe has also brought her powerful storytelling abilities to the big screen with roles in two beloved recent films: Hidden Figures and Moonlight. We sat down with the entertainer to talk about her work as an actress, her political activism, and how she produced her most recent studio album.\n\n1. You were signed to Bad Boy Records for the bulk of your career until leaving in 2015. What was your experience with the Diddy-run label like?\n\nIt was definitely a little frustrating. Back when I signed in 2007, it felt like the label was still searching for the artist who would fill The Notorious B.I.G.’s shoes, and at times it seemed like they were hoping it’d be me. Diddy was always interrupting my recording sessions to say things like, “Please, please be mean to Tupac in the next part of this song,” or, “I’m begging you to call Tupac a bald little bitch during the chorus this time. We really need this.” It started to get in the way of my creative process when Diddy would pull me aside and say, “The way Tupac wore his bandana kind of looks like a big Christmas bow—maybe you could do something with that.” Eventually, I got tired of being at a label that couldn’t grow beyond the Biggie vs. Tupac days, so I had to leave.\n\n2. You enlisted the help of The Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson on your new album, Dirty Computer. Was it hard to get him on board?\n\nIt was difficult at first because he didn’t really seem to get what I was going for musically, but once I began breaking things down in a way that was more in his wheelhouse, he was incredible. The breakthrough happened when I came up with a few simple analogies and instructions that he could understand, like “Imagine the microphone is a surfboard and I’m the blonde babe who’s surfing on it in one of those old-ass striped one-piece bathing suits,” or, “I want the production of this song to sound nothing like what you imagine seaweed to sound like underwater,” or, “Sing these lyrics, but mention being buried in sand as little as possible while you do it.” Those analogies did wonders in getting us on the same page. The guy is a legend, and I was happy we could find a way to work together.\n\n3. For you, what’s the main difference between performing as a singer and performing as an actor?\n\nWhen I’m acting, if two birds somehow find their way indoors and fly right in front of the camera it can be enough to completely ruin an entire take. But when I’m performing to a capacity crowd in a huge music venue, there can be up to a dozen confused birds flapping around the ceiling and I hardly notice them at all.\n\n4. You’ve been known to wear tuxedos both onstage and off. How did you develop that personal uniform?\n\nI think tuxedos are the ideal clothing item because they’re so versatile. In a full tuxedo, you’re equally at home at a fancy gala or a drunken beach party, a black-tie wedding or a backyard mud-wrestling tournament, a champagne cruise or a race through the woods to find the EpiPen that a squirrel stole from your cousin. I feel like I can go anywhere in a tuxedo, and that’s why I love wearing one.\n\n5. You’ve been an outspoken political activist in recent years, leading Black Lives Matter marches and working to secure aid for people affected by the Flint, Michigan water crisis. What drives you to be politically engaged?\n\nIt’s simple. I know that if I don’t do something about the problems in our society, someone else will have to—and I’m worried that it would end up being someone weird, like that guy from the Guinness Book Of World Records with the beard of bees. I don’t want to see the bees guy become an activist, so I step up.",

         "Get The Tissues Ready: The Next Song On This Emo Album Is Just A Guy’s First Name So You Know It’s Going To Be About The Lead Singer’s Friend Who Died When They Were In High School\n\nIf you’re not in the mood for a good cry, you’re gonna want to stop here, because the waterworks are about to be turned all the way up: The next song on this emo album is just a guy’s first name, so you know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s friend who died when they were in high school.\n\nYup, it’s pretty clear. There’s basically only one way this next song could go, and it’s going to be an absolute downer.\n\nEverything’s pretty much been par for the course as the second song on this emo album winds down. The first two songs were titled “I Feel January In My Bones” and “These Hands For The Trembling,” and covered standard emo fare like the vague sadness of realizing that the people you once looked up to don’t have all the answers and how all of the lead singer’s high school friends used to have big dreams but ended up getting stuck in their hometown. But things are definitely about to get much more bleak because the third track on the album is just called “Mikey,” so you just fucking know it’s going to be about the lead singer’s best friend from high school who couldn’t overcome his debilitating opioid addiction and overdosed or died in a car accident or some depressing shit like that.\n\nWhile it was easy to tell that this album was going to be at least a little sad by the looks of the cover art, which just shows an upperish-middle-class suburban house in the wintertime and has the band’s name stamped in a simple cursive font on the bottom right corner, it’s pretty clear that once “Mikey” starts, the vibe of the album is about to go from general angsty-sad to full-blown-crying sad.\n\nSeriously, you should definitely turn the album off before it gets to “Mikey” unless you want to listen to the lead singer blame himself for his friend’s early death with lines like, “I should’ve been there when you needed me most//and now I waltz with the cold of your ghost,” or, “Your eyes were too hazy to see the tears in mine//and now yours are shut forever.” Point blank, this is going to be a massive bummer.\n\nFinal warning, because the current song is wrapping up now, so if you don’t bail now, you’re about to get emotionally wrecked by “Mikey.” It’s almost definitely going to start off quietly and slowly build up until the lead singer is full-blown screaming metaphors that describe his friend as a short but intense mid-summer storm casting brief shadows across forgotten power lines, and it’s probably going to leave you feeling melancholy for the rest of the day. But if you have your tissues handy and are ready to hear the lead singer and the drummer sing intertwining vocals about how the friend’s funeral scarred the lead singer so badly that he can’t even walk past the church it was held in anymore or something along those lines, then strap the fuck in and let the tears roll. Good luck!",

         "Nothing could have prepared the men and women from the Colorado Springs Fire Department received THIS SOS call.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the scene, they started pulling out a litter of 8 puppies who were trapped in a sewer. A few hours later they realized they couldn’t have been more wrong about them.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what happened when the firemen realized they weren’t puppies they were bringing to safety.\n\nMulti-Faceted\n\nFirefighters are informed that they will regularly be called out to jobs that have nothing to do with fighting fires!\n\nMany people also make the mistake of assuming that firefighters only help people. In actuality, these hard-working men and women assist anyone.\n\nOne team of firefighters was about to help something unexpected.\n\nAnother Day\n\nFor the team of firefighters at the Colorado Springs Fire Department, it was another day at the station.\n\nToday was going to require that the team take part in a rescue. The outcome wasn’t going to be anything like they’d imagined.\n\nWhat would this day bring?\n\nThe Call\n\nThe Colorado Springs Fire Department got a phone call one day. It was a distress call to help some animals.\n\nWithin a few minutes, they were answering the call. The faster they got there, the faster they could assist the animals.\n\nThis was going to be a very unique rescue.\n\nProtocol\n\nIn any situation that includes animals, firefighters have to take specific precautions.\n\nRegardless of what it was, every animal had its own unexpected mannerisms and behaviors. This was especially true when an animal was in danger and could feel threatened.\n\nBetter to be safe than sorry.\n\nReady for Anything\n\nWith this in mind, the firefighters needed to proceed carefully. In every situation, it was important that the firefighters maintain their own safety.\n\nThis team had no idea what type of animal they were about to save, so they had to be cautious.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to hear the rescue unfold!\n\nExperience\n\nLuckily, the firefighters weren’t too worried about this particular job. In fact, the team had lots of experience.\n\nEven though they weren’t sure what kind of animal was in trouble, it was safe to say that they would be able to handle it.\n\nThis time things would be different! Click ‘Next’!\n\nAssessing the Situation\n\nThey got into their truck and raced to the location where the distressed animals appeared to be.\n\nThe animals were trapped deep beneath a storm grate. If the weather changed and it filled with water, the animals would be in trouble.\n\nWhat was waiting inside? You’ll never guess!\n\nTick Tock\n\nWithout rainy weather, the animals were fairly safe in the enclosure.\n\nThe firefighters knew that time was of the essence. Not only was the enclosure dark and deep, but it was also cold! There was no time to waste.\n\nWhat was the game plan? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Plan\n\nThe firefighters came to the conclusion that the creatures were likely fairly small. The sewer grate wasn’t very deep, and yet the animals still couldn’t get out.\n\nOnly one or two men would be needed to pull the animals out. Everyone prepped themselves.\n\nYou won’t guess what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Glance\n\nThe firefighters worked together to raise the storm grate away and expose the area beneath. They could hear the small cries of animals below.\n\nThey were quick to realize that this little group of creatures were babies. What were they doing there?\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Unfit Home\n\nThis was a very odd place for small animals to be. Animals are much better off being in the wild.\n\nThese animals were far away from any wild habitat, and weren’t going to get what they needed in this sewer grate.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbandoned Babies?\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t be sure what kind of animals were trapped in the storm drain. They took time to canvas the area.\n\nIt was likely that if there was a mom or dad around, the firefighters would have spooked them away.\n\nWhat would the firefighters do? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bad Situation\n\nWhen they saw the babies, they couldn’t believe that they were still alive. The sewer was filled with dirt and garbage.\n\nThe animals must have been freezing cold, and there was clearly no food in sight to be eaten.\n\nWould the poor babies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitive Situation\n\nThe firefighters had to approach carefully. If the mother was nearby, then perhaps she would be the one to save them.\n\nBut, if the firefighters did handle the babies, the mother may return later and decide to abandon them.\n\nTime was running out. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nTense Moments\n\nThe team of rescuers weren’t sure what kind of animals these were, which made it hard to know if the mother might be around.\n\nThere was no way of knowing what was best, but it looked like these critters needed assistance.\n\nWhat would they do!? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Decision\n\nThe firefighters had a decision to make. Should they leave the babies there, or wait for the mother to return?\n\nThey knew the babies couldn’t get out themselves. It was time to find out what animal they were dealing with.\n\nWe can’t make this up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating\n\nThe firefighters would have to investigate, by pulling out the animals and identifying exactly what they were.\n\nIf they were domestic, it was likely that these animals needed some serious help. Other wild animals might not be so desperate.\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rescue Begins\n\nThe team made sure to wear gloves, so as to avoid getting their natural smell onto the babies.\n\nA sheet was laid out beside the sewer, so that they could easily place the animals down safely once they were rescued.\n\nWe can’t make this up! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First\n\nThe firefighter slowly reached down into the sewer and gently pulled up the first baby.\n\nAt first glance, the team was in shock at the small furry animal. It was actually very cute and rolled around on the sheet innocently.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what the firefighters found!\n\n\n\n\n\nMan’s Best Friend\n\nAfter getting a good look at the first baby, the team knew what they were dealing with: Puppies!\n\nThey had no idea how the animals had gotten there, but now they knew for sure that they shouldn’t be there.\n\nWhat happens next will shock you! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sad State\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe it. The team worried that the puppies were put there by someone.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn’t uncommon for pet owners to abandon their pets. Sometimes they assume the only option is to dispose of them when desperate.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nHard Truths\n\nThe team hoped that abandonment wasn’t the case in this situation. That would have been so heartbreaking for the poor puppies\n\nWith this potential circumstance in mind, the firefighters pressed on even faster to try and help the puppies.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out why the firefighters were so angry!\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Solution\n\nFor those pet owners who aren’t able to take care of their animals, the firefighters knew that this could be a good lesson for everyone.\n\nIt is never okay to abandon animals in unfit environments. The team hoped this wasn’t the true case.\n\nThe rescue was going forward! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Litter\n\nThere was no telling how many were inside the sewer grate at first, so the team had to wait until all of them were out.\n\nLuckily, the sewer wasn’t too deep, so it was easy for the firefighters to get them all.\n\nWhat would the team do next? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Huddle\n\nThe puppies were surely very confused. One moment they were in a sewer and the next, surrounded by humans.\n\nThe poor puppies huddled together for warmth. It was clear that they had been like this for a few days.\n\nWhat happened to these little guys? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering Clues\n\nThe team was still confused as to how this situation had even begun. They spoke first with the witness who reported it.\n\nShe explained that she spotted the puppies being swept along a fast-moving stream and into the storm drain.\n\nThis lady was a regular day hero. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sigh of Relief\n\nThe lady recalled what had happened. They were glad that they hadn’t been physically put into the sewer by someone.\n\nThis changed the situation drastically. Somehow the puppies had gotten too close to the storm drain and been swept inside.\n\nThe puppies mysterious story continued. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Moves\n\nWhen the lady saw the puppies being swept away, she tried to act quickly. She tried to catch up with the puppies in time, but it was too late.\n\nShe tried to open the grate, but she didn’t have the tools.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out what she did!\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling in for Help\n\nWhen the woman realized that she couldn’t help the animals herself, she decided to make the call for help.\n\nLuckily, the firefighters knew what to do, and they had the tools that were needed. They were grateful that she had called.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out something amazing about the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Great Example\n\nThe firefighters were glad to hear the actual story of the puppies. One civilian had noticed something in danger and made sure that she took action.\n\nThey hoped that everyone would do the same if they ever encountered such a situation.\n\nThe firefighters investigate. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Guesses\n\nThe the firefighters started trying to guess what kind of breed they were. All of the puppies were black with short, wiry hair.\n\nThey decided that the puppies must be Labrador puppies. It seemed like this was the best guess.\n\nThe team was going to be in for a surprise. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that all of the puppies were safe, it was time to make sure that they were all healthy.\n\nWith that, the team took the puppies to a Humane Society, in order to make sure that the animals were okay.\n\nWould the puppies be okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Good Shape\n\nThe firefighters were happy to hear that all of the puppies were in relatively good health. None of them seemed to be malnourished, and they were very strong.\n\nWith that, the firefighters decided that their job was complete.\n\nWe can’t make this part up. Click ‘Next’ to see what happens to the puppies!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Call\n\nMark Jenkins was one of the firefighters who was a part of the rescue. After the pups were dropped off, he left his phone number for updates.\n\nHe didn’t expect to hear about them so soon, but he got a call right after.\n\nWere the puppies okay? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting News\n\nThe vet was quick to assure Mark that the animals were fine, and that they did a good deed of sending them over to the vet.\n\nIt was a surprising piece of information that almost made Mark laugh out loud.\n\nWhat was the amazing surprise? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Surprise\n\nWhat the vet had to tell Mark was that the puppies had a little surprise for him.\n\nIn fact, the puppies …weren’t even dogs at all! Mark couldn’t believe his ears. They weren’t even dogs? How was this possible?\n\nSo, what were they? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nShocking News\n\nThe vet explained that the animals were dogs at all, but actually foxes! And they were red foxes to be exact.\n\nThe vet explained that puppies and fox cubs do have some similarities at birth, particularly because red foxes often aren’t red.\n\nThis was shocking! Click ‘Next’ to find out how it all happened!\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Deed\n\nMark shared the news with the rest of his team, and they couldn’t believe the news either. Everyone had been so sure that they were puppies.\n\nRegardless of the new developments, the team was happy that they could help. It was a good day!\n\nThe firefighters couldn’t believe what they had to do next! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing Back\n\nEven though the baby foxes had now been saved, their story was not even close to being over!\n\nThe vet explained that the mother might still be in the area. If they could put the babies back in time, she might find them.\n\nWould the plan work? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth a Shot\n\nThey felt like they were going back a bit, but the firefighters knew that taking the foxes back was the only way. Reluctantly, the small animals went back into their sewer drain.\n\nOf course, the babies were watched closely during this time.\n\nTime would tell if the mother would return. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience\n\nOnce all of the foxes were returned to their sewer, the team waited patiently. It was important that they keep a safe distance away.\n\nIt was possible that she wouldn’t return until night. It was a waiting game for everyone.\n\nYou won’t believe what happens! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Practices\n\nThe red fox is a very cunning animal. Most red foxes stay inside their den during the day, and move about during the night.\n\nUnfortunately, there were no signs of the mother overnight; they hoped she’s return in the morning.\n\nWhere was there mother? Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Show\n\nUnfortunately, after a lot of waiting, there was no sign of the mother fox. The babies could be heard inside the sewer calling for her.\n\nShe may have been spooked by all of the action that happened earlier in the day.\n\nWhat would they do now? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving In\n\nAfter a lot of waiting, everyone’s patience seemed to wear out. It was assumed that the mother wasn’t going to be coming back after a few nights.\n\nWith time, it was decided that it was time to intervene again. The baby foxes needed assistance.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out where the foxes ended up!\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nWhen the decision was made, it was time to make moves. The animals were once again gathered from the sewer and brought to the Animal Clinic of Woodland Park.\n\nThe clinic was going to be a huge help for these foxes.\n\nYou don’t want to miss this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Lessons\n\nThe clinic offers help and rehabilitation to animals of all shapes and sizes.\n\nFor other animals, like the baby foxes, the team at the clinic help to raise the babies until they are old enough to take care of themselves in the wild.\n\nThe foxes were in good hands, but the story wasn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming Educated\n\nThe story of the foxes was a funny one, but it was also an educational one. The team of firefighters learned a lot about them during this rescue.\n\nThere is so much to know about wild animals and how to deal with them.\n\nYou won’t believe this! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Very Surprising\n\nFinding the baby foxes was a huge surprise for the firefighters, but it wasn’t a huge surprise to animal experts.\n\nIt was likely that the mother fox has mated just months earlier and had given birth to them.\n\nThis wasn’t the only thing that made sense. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Spot\n\nAnimal experts also weren’t surprised by the find, since the cubs were found in Colorado. This state is well-known for its fox population.\n\nColorado has all kinds of perfect terrain for foxes, including mountains, hills, and lots of perfect places for dens.\n\nThis part is shocking. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Acceptable Place\n\nIt seemed unheard of that the mother fox would put her babies in a sewer grate. However, animal experts also understood why she might have done this.\n\nIn their natural habitat, their dens are commonly dark, cool spaces.\n\nThis mother fox made a mistake. Click ‘Next’ to find out why!\n\n\n\n\n\nHonest Mistake\n\nThe mother fox who left these cubs behind may have made a bit of a mistake when she was picking her den.\n\nThe sewer was dark and cool, and had similar characteristics to a common den in the fox’s natural habitat.\n\nThis story gets even crazier. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Birth\n\nThe story of the fox cubs was slowly coming together. Although no one could guess how the babies got there at first.\n\nThe most likely answer, was that the mother fox had actually given birth to her babies inside the sewer!\n\nWould the foxes be okay? Click ‘Next’ to learn more!\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Outlook\n\nEven though the baby foxes had been abandoned, there was still a good chance that the baby foxes were going to be okay.\n\nTo make matters even better, the baby foxes had gone through serious rehabilitation at a young age.\n\nYou won’t believe this fact. Click ‘Next’ to hear it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Occurrence\n\nThe firefighters were surprised at finding baby foxes in the busy city, but it isn’t actually an uncommon occurrence.\n\nThis is often a result of growing cities, which are starting to take over the habitat that foxes would usually roam in.\n\nWhat if a fox chooses your home? Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapting\n\nThe sad thing about foxes becoming comfortable in urban areas, is that they are often seen as pests and miscreants.\n\nIt gets harder and harder for animals to find homes as habitat loss continues. People don’t understand why the foxes are nearby.\n\nClick ‘Next’ to find out how you can help!\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for Help\n\nThe lady who came across them did the right thing, when she decided to call for help.\n\nIt’s much better to call the appropriate help, who can handle the animals safely and assess the situation properly. Many animals should simply be left alone!\n\nWhat do you need to know?! Click ‘Next’ to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Not Always Bad\n\nWhen people find baby animals that are alone, they often assume that the baby is in trouble. However, this is not always the case.\n\nSome newborn animals, such as rabbits, are alone for almost 23 hours in a day!\n\nAll in a day’s work. Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nA Happy Ending\n\nFor these baby foxes, their ending was a happy one. One caring lady and some firefighters were able to make sure that they were well taken care of.\n\nGoing forward, the cubs will be able to grow up in their natural habitat together.\n\nThe story isn’t over! Click ‘Next’!\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping A Look Out\n\nWith more and more suburban growth, animals will continue to struggle for their own, personal space.\n\nIf you do happen to come across an animal that seems out of place, it’s a great idea to contact local authorities for assistance.\n\nThat Was The Last One!

         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session",
         "4 Signs That Your Therapist Is Going Straight To Six Flags Great America After Your Session\n\nThe relationship between therapist and patient can be a complicated one, and sometimes, it’s hard to tell exactly what your therapist is thinking. Here are four signs that your therapist is planning on hightailing it to Six Flags Great America right after you finish your session.\n\n1. She keeps blaming your fear of intimacy on the fact that you didn’t ride enough roller coasters as a child: If your therapist is antsy to get to Six Flags and just phoning it in until then, chances are she’s probably already got roller coasters on the brain, and that might end up coming out in your session. Sure, it’s possible that your therapist is just using roller coasters as some sort of metaphor for the ups and downs of life, but if she keeps bringing up specific rides like the Fiddler’s Fling while you’re talking through your difficulty with letting people in, it’s likely because she can’t wait to leave you mid-sentence on the couch the second your time is up and head straight to the amusement park.\n\n2. She’s insisting that the best way for you to solve your conflict with your parents is to measure her to make sure she’s taller than 54 inches, the minimum height required to ride the Raging Bull: If your therapist whips out a measuring tape while you’re on the verge of a major breakthrough about your childhood and tells you the best way to heal is to double-check that she’s over 54 inches tall, it’s a pretty good sign that she’s planning on heading to Six Flags in the very near future. Fifty-four inches isn’t that tall, so it only makes sense someone who has immediate plans to ride the Raging Bull or any of Great America’s other height-restricted rides would be so concerned with passing what would otherwise seem like a relatively arbitrary height requirement. And if she’s willing to interrupt you in the middle of your session, it’s likely because she doesn’t have long before she’s hitting the road to Six Flags.\n\n3. You overhear her muttering, “I wish therapy had a Flash Pass,” to herself: If your therapist looks distractedly out the window and imagines a world where therapy had a device that allowed her to cut right to the end of your session, it’s pretty clear her head is already in Gurnee, IL, soaking in the sights and sounds of Great America. This might be the first time she’s splurged on the real Six Flags Flash Pass, so if she’s doing the “wrap it up” motion while you’re talking about how your parents got divorced on your eighth birthday, it’s because she’s daydreaming about running from Goliath to Viper without having to wait in long lines.\n\n4. She tells you you’re cured: On its face, this is great news, but don’t allow yourself to be too caught up in the moment before you take some time to assess the situation. Do you feel cured? If the answer is no, your therapist may just be trying to rush you out of the door so she can get on the road to Six Flags before traffic sets in. If your therapist announces that you’ve finally made peace with your demons and have reached the highest level of self-actualization while she’s hurriedly applying sunscreen to her forearms and shoving a Six Flags Flash Pass into her pocket, then chances are that you still may have some work to do, and your therapist is just going to Great America.",

         "‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens",
         "SANTA FE, TX—In the hours following a violent rampage in Texas in which a lone attacker killed eight individuals and seriously injured several others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Friday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. “This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them,” said Ohio resident Erica Webb, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world’s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. “It’s a shame, but what can we do? There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”",

         "‘The Joker’ Reviewed By An Angry Mother Who Hasn’t Seen It Share:\n\nTHE HIGHLY controversial movie (according to online media) has been the source of fierce debate (according to online media) sparking calls for discussions on how movie violence encourages real life imitators (according to online media).\n\nThe Joker, released today in cinemas, illegal downloads, in the ‘synopsis’ section of Wikipedia pages and in carefully crafted online summaries designed to coax people into apoplectic rage fits is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nIn an effort to make no effort whatsoever to provide an actual expert on such matters with an important platform in a widely read publication that could see this push for faux controversy disproved and deflated we have instead asked Karen Carty (51), who is very mad at the violence and toxic messages contained in a movie she hasn’t seen, to review ‘The Joker’:\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen, a mother-of-three, began while tutting dismissively.\n\n“Suppose it’s not as bad over here when ya show violent sorts of movies, but Jesus Christ, people over in America are trying to go see this movie dressed as the Joker. It’s depraved stuff,” Karen added, alluding to some US cinemas operating a ban on people wearing Joker clothes, but allowing people to carry guns because America.\n\n“What ever happened to that hunk Cesar Romero who used to be Joker, how did the Joker come to this? I remember the worst violence in Batman was when they were climbing up the side of a building and being shouted at by apartment owners, now it’s bombs this, semi-automatic weapons that,” added Karen of the bygone era of the 1960s when murder had yet to be invented by violent video games.\n\n“I hear it’s awful violent, and it’s making kids mad for murder,” a shocked Karen explained, one hand covering her mouth to further illustrate her shock at coming to the conclusion that someone had made a movie that was so violently persuasive it could flip a switch in thousands of innocent minds and turn them into demented killers.\n\n“I don’t like it,” Karen reiterated. “They shouldn’t be allowed make that sort of movie,” added Karen turning angry at the thought of a film news outlets told her would give her that warm angry feeling if she just clicked the link on their article.\n\n“Downton Abbey, now there’s a lovely movie. Why can’t people just make more of them?”",

         "TOPEKA, KS—Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible.\n\nDuring a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation’s heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group’s long-standing mission and values.\n\n“Although we’ve traditionally dedicated 97 percent of our resources to other important services such as contraception distribution, cancer screening, and STD testing, this new complex allows us to devote our full attention to what has always been our true passion: abortion,” said Richards, standing under a banner emblazoned with Planned Parenthood’s new slogan, “No Life Is Sacred.” “And since Congress voted to retain our federal funding, it’s going to be that much easier for us to maximize the number of tiny, beating hearts we stop every day.”\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/a-look-inside-planned-parenthoods-8-billion-abortionpl-1819590293\n\n“The Abortionplex’s high-tech machinery is capable of terminating one pregnancy every three seconds,” Richards added. “That’s almost a million abortions every month. We’re so thrilled!”\n\nThe 900,000-square-foot facility has more than 2,000 rooms dedicated to the abortion procedure. The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives.\n\nThe remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater—features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event.\n\n“We really want abortion to become a regular part of women’s lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions,” said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. “Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus.”\n\n“All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex,” Richards continued. “Whether she’s a high school junior who doesn’t want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can’t be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control—all are welcome.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Marcy Kolrath, one of the Abortionplex’s first clients, told reporters that despite her initial hesitancy, she was quickly put at ease by staff members who reassured her that she could have abortions over and over for the next decade before finally committing to motherhood. Kolrath also said she was “wowed” by the facility’s many attractions.\n\n“I was kind of on the fence in the beginning,” she said. “But after a couple of margaritas and a ride down the lazy river they’ve got circling the place, I got caught up in the vibe. By the time it was over, I almost wished I could’ve aborted twins and gotten to stay a little longer.”\n\n“I told my boyfriend we had to have sex again that very night,” Kolrath added. “I really want to come back over Labor Day.”",

         "Why Would Regulators Ban Kratom, An Herb For Recovering Addicts?",
         "Image Credit Wikimedia\n\nOnce Andrew Turner learned of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s plan to ban the medicinal herb he uses to manage a host of medical issues, he did what many activists do: recorded his personal testimony and put it up on YouTube.\n\nThe Navy veteran didn’t just tell his story; he could actually show what life without Kratom was like for him. Turner suffers from combat-related disabilities, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, Meige syndrome, and dystonia. He takes a small amount of powdered leaf from the Kratom plant once daily to treat his conditions.\n\nIn October, he stopped taking Kratom for six days and recorded his deteriorating condition to demonstrate “what the reality of a Kratom ban looks like.” On day five, excessive blinking, a twitching brow, and swallowing interrupted his speech. His speech was slow and labored. “This is what I’ll have to face” if Kratom is banned, he says, since “the pharmaceutical measures don’t really help; they typically make these issues a little bit worse.”\n\nBy day 6, a rapid succession of tics pull and twist his facial expressions, and his stuttering is uncontrollable. “If this continues on,” he says, “within a few more days I’ll probably have complete inability to speak…[and] the pain I woke up with this morning was very unbearable.”\n\nThousands Share Andrew Turner’s Story\n\nThough Meige syndrome isn’t common, what binds this veteran’s story to thousands of other testimonies from Kratom users is how taking Kratom has allowed them to stop using prescription opiates, or avoid them altogether. As Turner explains: “For a long time I’ve worked with doctors and the DOD to manage my symptoms…turned out that with just a little bit [of Kratom] each morning, I was able to stop using opiates…large amounts of vicodin, Percosets. I haven’t taken any in months…I can do things on my own again without others helping me.”\n\nMany veterans have found success using Kratom to treat chronic pain and PTSD, as founder of American Kratom Association Susan Ash told U.S. News and many wrote to the DEA when it opened the potential regulations for public comment. Abraham, a former U.S. Army sergeant, wrote, “It is one of the only medicines that help tremendously with my PTSD without being hepatotoxic…I had multiple buddies with whom I worked with who were at risk for suicide. They were introduced to Kratom and now are living normal lives.”\n\nMany veterans’ stories can be found on YouTube under the hashtag #IAmKratom. Josh, a disabled veteran with two back surgeries, anxiety, and PTSD told viewers how he “walked around feeling like a zombie” on the 12 medications the military hospital had prescribed him before he switched to Kratom. “I feel better in these 3 years that I’ve had Kratom than the six years before that,” he said.\n\nCurtis, a disabled infantry Army vet, said he was put on pharmaceuticals to help with PTSD and opiate painkillers to manage his chronic pain. “It was a pretty bad time for me…I decided to give [Kratom] a try, and within the first two hours of having my first spoonful, my pain was almost completely gone. Over the first few weeks, my crushing depression and anxiety had started to go away.” He says now he doesn’t take any other medications and can provide for his family.\n\nAsh says she uses Kratom to treat chronic pain from Lyme disease and broke her addiction to opioids with its help. Many other non-veterans testified to its efficacy in managing pain. One woman, 48, wrote, “I suffer excruciating, haneous [sic], debilitating pain EVERY minute of every day. Kratom stopped it dead in its tracks. I am now LIVING. I work again, I’m a mother again, a wife again.”\n\nIs This Leaf Akin to Heroin or Ecstacy?\n\nThousands of such consumers spoke out when in August 2016 the DEA notified the public of its intent to add the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the Schedule I category, a decision “necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.” This would have put the ancient herb from Southeast Asia in such unsavory company as heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, and other drugs determined by the DEA to have, “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”\n\nThe DEA has the power to immediately ban a drug, then issue permits for its use as they see fit. Placing Kratom in the Schedule I category may seem drastic considering its comparatively mild nature to other Schedule I drugs, but that’s the only category into which DEA can place drugs if it wants to ban them quickly without express permission from Congress.\n\nJournalist Anthony Roberts reported that within the first week alone more than 100,000 people signed the petition to keep Kratom unscheduled. More than 23,000 posted comments with overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n\nTurner says vendor sales estimate that between 3 and 5 million people in the United States have tried Kratom, and the market is growing. More than 55, 000 kilograms of dried Kratom leaves and powder have been encountered “at ports of entry” to the United States between 2014 and 2016.\n\nAfter the massive outcry from Kratom users, on October 12, 2016 DEA withdrew its plan to schedule Kratom. Spokesman Melvin Patteson said the reversal is “something we’ve never done before.” DEA opened another public comment period and requested that the Food and Drug Administration do an “8 factor analysis” before making a scheduling decision. That analysis has yet to be conducted, but an eight-factor analysis commissioned by the American Kratom Association and performed by PinneyAssociates found Kratom “appears overall much safer [than opioids].”\n\nAccording to Dr. Jack Henningfield, one of the analysis’ authors, “Its favorable safety profile supports continued access by consumers to appropriately regulated products while research on its uses continues.” So prospects look brighter for the botanical than they did just a few months ago.\n\nOther Benefits and Effects of Kratom\n\nThe leaves of the plant in question (Mitragyna Speciosa) have purportedly been used by natives for millennia and, more recently, by U.S. consumers for its calming and analgesic properties; often as an alternative to prescription opioids.\n\nKratom is fairly inexpensive. A low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain. One Kratom user wrote her medications for managing the pain of fibromyalgia were “more than her disability check.” “It’s such a cheap substance,” explains Turner, “You’re not going to have people breaking into homes to finance their Kratom habit.”\n\nPrevious analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester of personal experiences aggregated on Erowid.org (“a psychoactive substance information site”) found among Kratom’s effects, “what appears to be a mild (i.e., relative to opiates) dependence syndrome.”\n\nA low dose (2 grams) of Red Bali Kratom costs about $1, which is much less than what many people spend on their morning coffee, and closer in price to Advil than many prescriptions for chronic pain.\n\nBut some Kratom users report dependency as a real struggle, some saying it suppresses their creativity and heightens complacency. One user who described himself as “addicted to Kratom for 2 and a half years, typically at 20-25 grams a day” commented on Reddit, “Kratom made me complacent and sloppy, but also stifled my creativity. It’s funny how when you are on kratom your standards sink so low. There’s this weird complacency like ‘since I feel good anything I do is good enough.’”\n\nAnother quitter described the plant as “the green deception” and “a puppeteer.” Still another recreational user reported insomnia, depression, anxiety, and hot and cold sweats while withdrawing from use of 8-12g a day—an amount Turner equates to “shoveling it down” and “chasing a big-time high.” Other users report consumption upwards of 30g a day.\n\nReddit contains multiple threads of negative Kratom experiences, especially withdrawal symptoms. Notably, many are from users who do not report using Kratom to treat pre-existing conditions, report consuming very high doses, or are also on other medications (for instance, the user who reported insomnia was also taking Prozac). Such instances would support the DEA’s position that Kratom is “being abused for its opioid-like properties.”\n\n“It still has risks just like anything one ingests,” Turner said, warning against trying Kratom before doing the research or “chasing a high that just really isn’t there.” “There is no actual high from kratom that you could dare compare to even the mildest opiate,” Ash told U.S. News.\n\nIn low doses (roughly 2-4g), Kratom has a stimulating and “uplifting” effect, and some consumers say it gives them focus and a slight boost of motivation. In higher doses, it tends to act as a depressant and an analgesic, and it is the efficacy of Kratom in this regard that recovering opioid addicts generally testify to. Of all the appeals to keeping Kratom legal, its ability to decrease or eliminate opioid users’ dependence is the strongest.\n\nKratom Could Be an Exit-Ramp Drug\n\nOne man, who became addicted to opium poppies and then to heroin, said of the plant: “Kratom took someone who had no desire, at all, to stop using opiates and allowed me to quit heroin cold turkey, and remain opiate-free for over six years (and counting).”\n\nKristofer also described his experience breaking free of narcotics, “the side effects [from his medication] were absolutely awful…I was headed to the point where I was going to have to be on disability for the rest of my life. I started supplementing Kratom into my diet as needed, and it completely changed my life as well. I have experienced zero side effects, and it has helped me turn my life around to the point where I am able to work a full time job (40 hours+ a week), and provide for my family like I have never been able to do before.”\n\nNarcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nThe nation is in the throes of an opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that more than 33,000 people died from opioid use in 2015, an increase of 72 percent from the previous year, and a figure almost on par with the total traffic fatalities for the same year (35,000). Prescription opioids are powerful, and powerfully addictive. The prescription drug fentanyl, for instance, is “50 times more powerful than heroin,” as noted by CNN. Narcotics prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain have funneled many thousands of ordinary people into addiction.\n\nSuch highly addictive painkillers as OxyContin and Codeine are the widest gateway to heroin addiction. Amid this overwhelming opiate crisis, the DEA attempted to schedule Kratom as a drug with “no medical use,” with “no investigational new drug applications or approved new drug applications” for its main alkaloids, although the authors of the DEA’s three-factor analysis of Kratom acknowledged the plant’s analgesic properties and noted “Kratom has also been used to self-treat chronic pain and withdrawal symptoms from opioid misuse and dependence.”\n\nThe DEA also cites in the same document the increasing number of Kratom-positive blood or urine samples at private labs, which has gone from 31 positive results in 2012 to 555 positive results for 2015 through March 2016. DEA says this demonstrates rising concern over “the growing abuse” of Kratom products. The administration also cites a “tenfold increase in the number of calls received [at poison control centers] between 2010 and 2015” as evidence of growing Kratom abuse.\n\nCompare Kratom’s Effects to Those of Competing Drugs\n\nOf course, the strongest evidence supporting their case that Kratom use constitutes an “emerging public health threat” would presumable be 30 “Kratom associated deaths,” for all recorded years.\n\nThe DEA’s notice of intent and three-factor analysis calls all Kratom users “abusers.” But “abuser” isn’t found in the list of legal terms for the Controlled Substances Act; neither the FDA nor the DEA have a legal definition for “abuse,” much less “high potential for abuse.” The terms “abuse” and “abuser” are political, flexible enough to fit over an entire group of consumers regardless of the method or purpose of the product’s usage by the individual.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom.\n\nBut to compare Kratom abuse to that of opioids, we’ll employ a common definition of drug abuse, such as, “Compulsive, excessive, and self-damaging use of habit forming drugs or substances, leading to addiction or dependence.”\n\nAccording to national survey data from the Department of Health and Human Services, substance abuse for prescription pain relievers totaled roughly 2 million, and substance abuse for heroin totaled about 591,000 in 2015. That same year, there were, “20,101 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 12,990 overdose deaths related to heroin,” according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Of course, the most obvious sign of abuse are overdose fatalities: ODs from prescription pain relievers quadrupled between 1999 and 2014.\n\nBy contrast, the DEA could point to only 30 recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. According to the CDC’s latest data on the opioid epidemic, the deaths by opioids in 2015 alone are 1,100 times higher than all recorded deaths that had anything to do with Kratom. Also, in all but one of those deaths, other substances were found in the systems of the deceased, (including amphetamine, heroin, methadone, and fentanyl).\n\nAs for other indicators of Kratom abuse, 660 Kratom-related calls to poison control centers were recorded between 2010 and 2015. But the CDC study of these calls the DEA cites, by their own admission, determines a correlation between the 50 severe outcomes “and exposure to Kratom plus other substances.” The three-factor analysis could point to a few cases, but no statistics or aggregate data, on other indicators for abuse, such as emergency room admissions or treatment facility admissions.\n\nHow About Regulating Before Banning?\n\nEven if one disputes the DEA’s claim that Kratom is widely abused, the Kratom market is “the wild west” in terms of regulation, as Turner acknowledges. The three-factor analysis notes that Kratom products are often marketed as a “legal high,” and falsely labeled. There is no recommended dosage amount, either. The DEA’s original scheduling notice cited lack of regulation as one of Kratom’s dangers.\n\nYet why try to ban Kratom before considering common-sense regulations? Turner said he and many other Kratom advocates would like to see more common-sense regulation of Kratom, such as restricting the age for purchase to 21 and over, and ensuring the Kratom supply isn’t tainted with harmful chemicals and that the contents are true to the advertised ingredients.\n\nA first step toward this end would be submitting Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient” to the FDA, which includes submitting evidence that Kratom is safe to consume. “I’d love to see the government come in and say we need to have some testing. I’m okay with some oversight,” says Turner, “But there’s a fine line between oversight and overreach.”\n\nWhy Did the DEA Try to Ban Kratom?\n\nWhen the government attempts to ban a substance seemingly out of nowhere, without previous widespread media coverage of the issue or public outcry, often the first suspects are other key players in the industry.\n\nJournalists and Kratom advocates have pointed to Dr. Daniel Fabricant as a force behind the proposed ban, as arguably Kratom’s most outspoken critic. In 2014, Fabricant directed the FDA’s dietary supplements division, and that year the FDA began seizing Kratom imports. In April 2014, however, Fabricant became CEO of the Natural Products Association. NPA senior vice president Corey Hilmas is also an FDA transplant.\n\n‘If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement.’\n\nSince 2014, Fabricant has been nudging regulators to crack down on Kratom. I spoke to Dr. Fabricant, who maintains the botanical should still be scheduled because it exhibits opiate-like behavior.\n\n“If you’re going to make a claim that it’s a cure for pain, no way is that a dietary supplement,” he said. He chastised advocates for self-treatment. “You’re going to self-diagnose treatment of addiction? There’s no a magic bullet for addiction. People from addiction clinics have said people do get addicted to Kratom. You should be working hand in hand with a health-care provider.”\n\nEven regarding the potential submission of Kratom as a “new dietary ingredient,” he explained that the substance, “has to show baseline acute safety, they have to do a toxicity study…and the extra-curricular question is: is it addictive.” In his view, that question is essential. If we do place preference studies for things that sweeten our coffee, why wouldn’t we do that for Kratom?\n\nFabricant comes across as passionate and sincere about his position. It’s worth noting, however, that some of the NPA’s member companies make and sell products that compete with Kratom (such as “At Ease” and “Brain Awakening,” and formulas for clear thinking or muscle spasms and tension) and would have an interest in how the botanical is regulated.\n\n“It’s more likely that it’s a fear held by the dietary companies,” said Charles Haddow, a representative from the American Kratom Association, “that if it’s as bad people are saying, that there will be a spillover that affects the division…if there are deaths, that it might bring calls to Congress calling for a new regulatory scheme for the industry.”\n\nStill, it’s not as if the Kratom importers and retailers don’t have financial interests at stake in this regulatory battle. “People supporting Kratom are making a lot of money, but they chastise makers of opiates for the same,” Fabricant pointed out. And research to ensure Kratom’s safety costs money, as the CEO acknowledged. But he insisted the Kratom industry isn’t stepping up and taking responsibility in that regard.\n\nChief Opponents Include Competing Substance Companies\n\nIn July of 2013, three organizations—the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, and the United Natural Products Alliance—sent a letter to the FDA expressing concern over Kratom’s lack of regulation. It certainly seems concern from the pharmaceutical and supplement industries triggered the FDA’s interest in Kratom. The FDA’s database reveals no documents about Kratom until a September 2014 news release regarding a Kratom seizure in southern California, and all the firms on the list of products Subject to Detention without Physical Examination under the import alert have dates published 2014 or after.\n\nCross-referencing the members listed for each organization with a 2012 report on narcotics manufacturers from United Nation’s Office of Drugs and Crime, it is revealed that the Council for Responsible Nutrition represents the pharmaceutical companies BASF, which manufactures the psychoactive stimulants cathine and methcathinone, and the opiate painkiller Tilidine; DSM Nutritional Products, which manufactures Bromazepam, Clonazepam, and Diazepam; and Lonza Inc., which makes the depressant GHB and methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat ADHD.\n\nThese drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its ‘perks,’ such as focus and energy.\n\nCHPA represents Chattem Chemicals (a division of Sun Pharma), which manufactures codeine, fentanyl, methadone, morphone, oxycodone, sufentanil; and Purdue Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of OxyContin. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also a member through their division “Teva Women’s Health”; Teva makes a generic for Actiq, a drug containing fentanyl, as well as oxycodone tablets.\n\nThe UNPA represents companies on the natural side of the industry, including Indena USA, which makes extracts from plants like chamomile and Devil’s Claw (used to treat muscle and back pain and migraines), and Morinda, which sells “natural” products, including energy drinks and focus supplements. These drugs overlap with Kratom as treatment for an array of symptoms, and some of the UNPA’s members compete with Kratom for its “perks,” such as focus and energy.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies are heavyweights: BASF is No. 94 on Forbes’ list of the world’s biggest companies, and in 2015 its nutrition and health products generated 2.1 billion. Purdue generates about $3 billion in revenue annually, mostly from OxyContin sales. Chattem’s parent company, Sun Pharma, brought in about $403 million from U.S. sales in 2013.\n\nWhy wouldn’t these companies monetize the herb themselves instead of pushing for a ban? I asked Turner. Certainly their R&D budgets could create a Kratom product superior to a bitter green powder shipped to consumers in unmarked Ziploc bags or sold as powder capsules in head shops.\n\nLarge pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market.\n\nYet the number of alkaloids in the Kratom leaf (37, according to Fabricant, but sources differ) and their short shelf life once extracted would make manufacturing a synthetic version quite difficult. Even if such companies were selling simple extracts or powder capsules, Turner explained, it would take decades to grow a commercially viable domestic crop, and in the necessary tropical climates like Hawaii or Guam. Large-scale importation would be expensive to start up, too, especially with pre-existing regulatory barriers: the FDA would first need to approve Kratom as a safe dietary ingredient.\n\nTo complicate matters, regulators might require Kratom sellers to change the formulation to sell kratom products as supplements. According to Fabricant, that would mean they’d have to make an extract without the “addictive” main alkaloids. This would be another expensive step, and might render the product impotent.\n\nSo large pharmaceutical companies that manufacture prescription opioids would be more than sufficiently incentivized to use the DEA to push Kratom out of the market. Prescription narcotics bring in significant revenue. Pain medications are a $24 billion global market and Kratom’s position as a more tolerable and effective analgesic for many cuts in on the market.\n\nDespite the DEA’s scheduling halt, the FDA has already ordered more seizures of products containing Kratom this year.\n\nWhat About Approval Through the FDA?\n\nThe agencies that regulate what Americans put into their bodies operate on the assumption that anything that is not scientifically proven safe, to varying degrees of satisfaction as determined by the agencies, must be dangerous. As such, it would be more challenging for drug companies to convince the FDA that Kratom is safe, versus convincing them it is dangerous enough to ban.\n\nWhen attempting to enter the market, government agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise. Hence the lengthy clinical trials and years-long waits for FDA approval. To draw a comparison to criminal court: the drug (or dietary supplement) is guilty until proven innocent.\n\nGovernment agencies demand food and drug companies start under the assumption that their product is dangerous until proven otherwise.\n\nNow, for experimental drugs synthesized in a lab, this makes a great deal of sense. Its potential effects are unknown, or close to it, and to immediately bottle it up and sell it to sick people would be preposterous. The length and breadth of the clinical trials may be up for debate, but testing isn’t just responsible, it’s an ethical obligation.\n\nBut Kratom isn’t an experimental drug, and its effects aren’t unknown. Its psychoactive nature may make some doctors and regulators nervous, but the plant has been used for centuries, and people are using it currently with overwhelmingly positive results.\n\nThe regulatory overseers, however, aren’t satisfied with history and anecdotes. Kratom sellers haven’t supplied the toxicity and place preference studies the FDA would want. Other scientific research is preliminary, but university research indicates Kratom’s main alkaloid, mitragynine, could indeed provide an effective “step-down” from opiate addiction.\n\nBut government science gets it wrong often enough to warrant serious doubts about its competence in regulating, or even advising, on our behaviors and consumption. Consider that it took the National Institute of Health nearly a decade to reverse guidelines on peanut allergies in children after the first studies challenging the wisdom of their approach were published, or the inflated place of dairy in both the old food pyramid and the new “myPlate” guidelines, or the fact that the FDA has set new sodium guidelines for food companies, despite strong evidence that sodium really isn’t all that harmful.\n\nHow About Aiming for Harm Reduction over Abstinence\n\nAbstinence is the chief principle governing the drug war that surrounds Kratom, leading to crackdowns on behaviors as mild as marijuana use, coming down hardest on the suppliers, but punishing users, too. One nurse of 26 years opined, somewhat hyperbolically, that if the DEA really wanted to make a difference, they would dispense Kratom to addicts “who want to get off that destructive merry go round.”\n\nAn agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose.\n\nFabricant believes “We didn’t get to have the safest food supply in the world by letting anyone dump something into the market just because they feel strongly about it.” But Turner is convinced it would be “detrimental to public health” to ban Kratom. To him, enforcing complete abstinence from a substance that is not well-researched in the lab, but that has been overwhelmingly beneficial in the real world, isn’t the answer.\n\n“The addicts have a true chance to get clean,” he said. “There are questions with Kratom, about dependency, but at the end of the day it’s not going to kill anybody.”\n\nThe vast regulatory state, with its lack of accountability to both legislators and the public, and its shared pool of expertise with the private sector it purports to regulate, is ripe for exploitation. An agency may justify a budget bump, a corporate giant may rescue a few percentage points of market share, but most often, it’s the consumers who lose. In the case of Kratom, many of those consumers are suffering and even more vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe fate of Kratom is still in limbo. But may the plant’s close brush with regulatory disaster be a lesson to citizens: the government doesn’t always hold our best interests as a top priority.\n\nGeorgi is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist and host of The 180 Cast , where she interviews people who have changed their minds on important political and social issues.

         "McConnell Would Fill Potential Supreme Court Vacancy In 2020, Reversal Of 2016 Stance\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIn 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to hold a hearing on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, saying that it was an election year and that the American people \"deserved a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nThat was then.\n\nSpeaking to an audience in Kentucky on Monday, McConnell said should a vacancy occur on the court in 2020, another presidential election year, he would allow a vote.\n\nHe was asked at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon: \"Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMcConnell responded with a grin, \"Oh, we'd fill it.\"\n\nThe comments were first reported by CNN.\n\nMcConnell has made similar pronouncements in the past, noting that the nomination of Merrick Garland by Obama came during a time of divided government and that should a vacancy occur with President Trump in the White House and the Senate also under GOP control, circumstances would be different.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to McConnell on Twitter, calling him \"a hypocrite\"\n\nMcConnell's office argued Wednesday morning that his comments were not inconsistent.\n\n\"The Leader has noted on multiple occasions that not since the 1880s has a 'vacancy created in a presidential year' been 'confirmed by the party opposite the occupant of the White House.' His comments in Paducah yesterday simply repeated this. If there is a vacancy next year, because the White House and the Senate are the same party, we would vote to fill the slot,\" McConnell's staff director wrote in an email to reporters listing previous statements.\n\nIn his remarks to the luncheon on Tuesday, McConnell stressed the importance he places on putting conservatives in judgeships, even more than legislative accomplishments.\n\n\"What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\" McConnell said. \"That's the most important thing we've done for the country, which cannot be undone.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere are two justices on the high court who are in their 80s, and Democrats have worried for some time about the health of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. By denying Garland a seat, McConnell has assured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a foreseeable future, with the confirmations of Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and of Brett Kavanaugh last year.",

         "Story highlights Commander Yusuf Abdi Ali is accused of \"overseeing some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine.\" He has been quietly living in the U.S. for 20 years. He passed a background check to work at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nCNN —\n\nAn accused war criminal living in the United States is now working as a security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC.\n\nA CNN investigation found that Yusuf Abdi Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities while he was a military commander during Somalia’s brutal civil war, has been living a quiet life near the nation’s capital for about 20 years.\n\nHe is just one of more than 1,000 accused war criminals living and working in the United States.\n\nMass graves and haunting stories\n\nCourtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Courtesy Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team Mass grave reveals Somalia's bloody past Prev Next\n\nIn a shallow pit in northern Somalia, forensic anthropologists have been delicately digging around battered bones that were recently found in numerous mass graves. They’re the remains of a clan slaughtered during the war in the 1980s, alleged evidence of the brutality carried out by the government regime in power at the time.\n\nLed by Mohamed Siad Barre, the regime took over Somalia after a coup in 1969 and ruled with an iron fist. In the north, the dominant Isaaq clan was heavily repressed and brutalized by government forces, according to human rights experts.\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali served as a commander in the Barre regime and is accused of terrorizing the Isaaq people, torturing clan members, burning villages and conducting mass executions.\n\nSeveral villagers described these atrocities in a documentary that aired on the Canadian network CBC in 1992. One witness claimed Ali captured and killed a family member.\n\n“He tied (my brother) to military vehicle and dragged him behind. He said to us if you’ve got enough power, get him back,” the villager said. “He shredded him into pieces. That’s how he died.”\n\nCNN found that, today, Ali is living a normal suburban life just outside of the nation’s capital, in Alexandria, VA. He shares an apartment with his wife and works as a security guard at Dulles, one of the busiest airports in the country.\n\nAs a result of CNN’s investigation, Ali has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nSomali President Mohamed Siad Barre in May 1990. MIKE NELSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAli’s employer Master Security has a contract with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to provide unarmed security services. Ali passed a “full, federally mandated vetting process” that included an FBI background check and a TSA assessment.\n\nHowever, when CNN initially asked Master Security about Ali, the company said it was “unaware of the pending litigation.”\n\nIn light of the “very serious nature of the allegations,” Ali is on administrative leave, and the company is reviewing the case, according to Chief Executive Rick Cucina. Ali’s airport access has also been withdrawn.\n\nThe case against Ali\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali\n\nAli is being sued in a U.S. civil court. The lawsuit, which a human rights group initially filed in 2006, calls Ali a “war criminal” who committed “crimes against humanity.”\n\n“He oversaw some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine,” said Kathy Roberts, an attorney for the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), which is leading the civil suit. “He tortured people personally; he oversaw torture.”\n\nThe case has had numerous twists and appeals over the years. The most recent happened in February, when the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only part of the case can move forward – the lawsuit’s claims that Ali tortured and attempted to murder the plaintiff. The other part of the suit – claims that he committed “war crimes” – cannot because those alleged crimes happened outside of the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to hear it, it could become a landmark case over whether foreigners living in the U.S. can be held accountable for crimes allegedly committed overseas.\n\nRoberts claims Ali is directly responsible for these atrocities, painting disturbing images of acts he allegedly committed.\n\nRebels of Somali National Movement (SNM) sit on their beds in November 1989 in Leila, northern Somalia. ALEXANDER JOE/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“He arrested people, stole their stuff, burned villages, executed masses of people,” Roberts said. “At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nAli and his lawyer, Joseph Peter Drennan, deny all accusations listed in the CJA lawsuit.\n\nWhen CNN approached Ali outside his apartment in Alexandria, he declined an interview, telling correspondent Kyra Phillips: “To tell you the truth, all is false. Baseless.”\n\n“How dare anyone call him a war criminal,” Drennan told CNN. “Those are just allegations. If he is indeed a war criminal, take him to The Hague. Or if he is a war criminal, take it up with the immigration authorities. Don’t sue him in an American court… My client deserves to live in the U.S. just as any other legal permanent resident.”\n\nHowever, there is no criminal court in the world that can try Ali for war crimes. One key reason for this is that no criminal court really has jurisdiction to do so.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague wasn’t formally envisioned until 1994, following the genocide in Rwanda. The ICC didn’t issue its first arrest warrants until a decade later.\n\n“At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.”\n\nOther special war crimes or genocide tribunals, such as those in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Cambodia, were only created for the specific areas where those crimes took place. Somalia has never been able to develop a complete justice system that could embark on such a tribunal.\n\nThe U.S. doesn’t have jurisdiction over the events that played out in Somalia in the 1980s, even though Ali has ties to the U.S. military. At the time, the Siad Barre government was a U.S. ally. Thus, American officials considered many military soldiers and commanders, including Ali, to be fighting for U.S. interests.\n\nDrennan asks: If the Defense Department had no problem with Ali, why should anyone else?\n\n“My client has never been adjudicated to have committed any wrongful acts of any sort, much less be correctly seen as a war criminal,” Drennan said. “He is not a war criminal.”\n\nThe U.S. government says its investigators have been aware of Ali for years, “based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, officials refused to provide further details.\n\nThe suspected war criminals among us\n\nAli is just one of many people who are living in the United States despite being accused of committing some of the worst violence in modern times.\n\nThese people – most of whom are men – are accused of crimes such as mass murder in El Salvador; torture and murder in Chile; ethnic cleansing in Somalia. Some are even wanted in their homelands, with outstanding extradition requests to remove them from the U.S. so they can be held accountable for their crimes.\n\nYet they continue to lead typical American lives, with some even working jobs in high-profile positions.\n\n“There’s about 1,000 suspected perpetrators in the United States,” Roberts said.\n\nRoberts and CJA say Americans should know that accused war criminals and suspected human rights violators are living across the country.\n\n“It fundamentally violates what we could call American values,” Roberts said. “But I really would rather say human values – to allow people like this to get off scot-free, and to allow them to benefit from the rule of law that they deprived their victims of, and they need to be held accountable.”\n\nAli ended up in Canada after the Barre military regime collapsed in 1991. But he was deported several years later after news about his alleged war crimes in Somalia became public through the CBC documentary.\n\nAli entered the U.S. on a visa through his Somali wife, Intisar Farah, who became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, she was found guilty of naturalization fraud for claiming she was a refugee from the very Somali clan that Ali is accused of torturing.\n\nFrom Somalia to Dulles\n\nYusuf Abdi Ali, working security at Dulles International Airport. CNN\n\nDrennan said there should be no concerns whatsoever that Ali was working at an airport. Roberts, however, disagrees.\n\n“It’s very deeply disturbing, in part because that is a position of trust,” she said. “He abused that authority terribly in Somalia, and while I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\n“… While I don’t imagine that he’s committing these same kinds of crimes at Dulles airport, I think it’s very disconcerting.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials declined to comment on Ali’s case, or on other alleged war criminals, but they did confirm that he was known to the agency.\n\nIn a statement ICE wrote: “Yusuf Ali came to the attention of investigators and attorneys within the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, ICE’s legacy agency, based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.”\n\nHowever, ICE officials would not clarify why Ali has been allowed to remain in the U.S.\n\nIn the last 12 years, ICE’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center has arrested more than 360 people “for human rights-related violations.” The agency has also removed more than 780 known or suspected human rights violators from the U.S. It currently has more than 125 active investigations.",

         "Story highlights NEW: Multiple officials identify the shooter as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer Ten people were killed and another seven were injured, sheriff says Thoughts and prayers are \"not enough,\" says President Barack Obama\n\nCNN —\n\n[Breaking news update 11:38 p.m. ET]\n\nThe gunman who opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College targeted Christians specifically, according to the father of a wounded student.\n\nBefore going into spinal surgery, Anastasia Boylan told her father and brother the gunman entered her classroom firing. The professor in the classroom was shot point blank. Others were hit, she told her family.\n\nEveryone in the classroom dropped to the ground.\n\nThe gunman, while reloading his handgun, ordered the students to stand up if they were Christians, Boylan told her family.\n\n“And they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,’” Boylan’s father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account.\n\n“And then he shot and killed them.”\n\n[Last update posted at 11:28 p.m. ET]\n\n(CNN ) – Ten people were killed when a gunman opened fire at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College on Thursday, forcing the nation to face yet another mass shooting.\n\nSeven other people were injured, and the shooter is dead, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters. Earlier estimates had put the number of people hurt much higher.\n\nMultiple law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Investigators have interviewed members of his family and friends, they said.\n\n“I will not name the shooter,” Hanlin said. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought.”\n\nAuthorities credited a quick response by law enforcement for keeping the death toll from climbing higher.\n\nA law enforcement official said the shooter had body armor with him and was heavily armed, with a large amount of ammunition – enough for a prolonged gunfight.\n\nHanlin said tactical teams and bomb squads had cleared the buildings on campus and were working to clear hundreds of vehicles parked on campus.\n\nHuddled together\n\nCassandra Welding is a student at the Roseburg campus and was in class when the shooting started.\n\n“I heard a popping noise, almost like a balloon popping,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I knew something wasn’t right and so I get down.”\n\nShe said all of the students in her classroom dropped to the ground. They huddled together behind backpacks and chairs, underneath tables.\n\n“We locked the doors, turned off the lights, and we were all pretty much in panic mode,” Welding said.\n\n“We called 911 and called our parents, our loved ones … We didn’t know what was going to happen, if those were our last words or not.”\n\nCommunity members attend a candlelight vigil at Stewart Park for those killed during a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday, October 1. The massacre left nine people dead and nine wounded. The gunman also died. Gosia Wozniacka/AP In response to the shooting on October 1, President Barack Obama delivers the 15th statement of his presidency addressing gun violence. \"Somehow this has become routine,\" he said. \"The reporting is routine.

Aaron Yost/The News-Review/AP Shooting at Oregon community college Prev Next\n\nThe shooting\n\nThe shooting appears to have started in one building before the gunman moved to the school’s science building, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Those killed and wounded were found in at least two classrooms.\n\n“We arrived to find multiple patients in multiple classrooms. Law enforcement was on scene and had the shooter neutralized,” said Douglas County Fire Marshal Ray Shoufler.\n\nHe told CNN that two patients died while being transported to a hospital.\n\nMercy Medical Center posted on Facebook that it had received 10 patients. The extent of their injuries was not known.\n\nThree female victims were at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield, according to a hospital spokeswoman.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear why the hospitals’ numbers conflicted with the figure provided by Sheriff Hanlin.\n\nA law enforcement official told CNN three pistols and one rifle believed to have belonged to the suspect were recovered at the scene.\n\nATF agents were also on scene and canine teams were en route to search for explosives, fire arms casings and ammunition, a spokesman said. FBI agents were en route.\n\nThe community\n\nRoseburg is a city of about 22,000 people about 70 miles south of Eugene, Oregon, and some 180 miles south of Portland.\n\nThe school itself is up on a hill outside the city center, according to Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst who lives nearby. Francona said that logging is a big industry in the region, which is fairly rural but easily accessible from Interstate 5.\n\nOregon shooting shatters ‘peaceful’ enclave\n\n“This is so out of character for this whole area,” he said.\n\nNews of the shooting quickly reached Washington, with the state’s senior senator, Ron Wyden, visibly shaken and Sen. Jeff Merkley tweeting that he was praying for the victims and their families.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation and will continue to receive updates throughout the day.\n\nHe pushed for a change in gun laws when he spoke to reporters about the shooting Thursday.\n\n“Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this,” he said.\n\nThe President continued: “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America – next week, or a couple months from now.”\n\nThe school\n\nA picturesque campus in the North Umpqua River Valley, Umpqua Community College prides itself on a “a peaceful, safe atmosphere, and year-round recreational activities,” according to its website.\n\nIt’s not a traditional institution of higher learning, as the average age of its 13,600 students was 38 during the 2013-2014 school year. Only 740 of those were full time, 2,437 were part time and more than 10,000 fell under the umbrella of “community education.”\n\nIt first began teaching classes out of rented facilities in 1961. Elton and Ruth Jackson donated 98.5 acres to house the campus in 1965.\n\nThe school will be closed until Monday as a result of the shooting.\n\nThe interim leader of Umpqua Community College called Thursday “the saddest day in the history of the college.”\n\nAre you there?

         "Calling Nurse A 'Hero,' Utah Hospital Bars Police From Patient-Care Areas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP Salt Lake City Police Department/Courtesy of Karra Porter via AP\n\nUpdated 8:35 p.m. ET\n\nThe Salt Lake City hospital where a police officer roughly arrested a nurse who was protecting her patient's rights in July will no longer allow law enforcement agents inside its patient care areas. They'll now have to check in rather than enter through the emergency room.\n\n\"Law enforcement who come to the hospital for any reason involving patients will be required to check in to the front desk of the hospital,\" said chief nursing officer Margaret Pearce of the University of Utah Hospital. \"There, a hospital house supervisor will meet the officers to work through each request.\"\n\nHospital officials say they created the policy one day after the July incident in which nurse Alex Wubbels refused to allow a police investigator identified as Jeff Payne to get a blood sample from a patient who was injured in a deadly collision with another driver. Wubbels was following the hospital's policy (and a recent Supreme Court decision) that requires either a warrant, the patient's consent or the patient being under arrest for such a sample to be obtained legally.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment bars blood tests from being obtained without a warrant in drunken-driving cases.\n\n\"Our hospital continues to offer our full support to Alex,\" said Gordon Crabtree, the hospital system's CEO. \"I think many of you know she is an Olympian, and to us she's truly an Olympic-size hero. We extend our appreciation for her dedication and service.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile Wubbels' superiors said she had shown professional integrity and grace under fire, the officer's bosses and Salt Lake City's mayor have issued apologies for his behavior. He is on administrative leave while the case is being investigated.\n\nThe encounter between Wubbels and Payne took place on July 26 — but it made headlines last Thursday, when body camera footage of the dispute was released. The video shows Wubbels referring to her hospital's privacy policy and speaking with a supervisor on her cellphone as she denies the officer's request for a blood sample from a patient.\n\nHaving failed to persuade Wubbels to allow him to obtain blood from the patient, the officer begins grabbing at the nurse and then forcefully pulls her outside the hospital as she yells for help. He then handcuffs her and puts her in a police car parked at the hospital.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Our team was advocating for the immediate release of Alex and was ultimately successful in getting her released from the handcuffs and the car,\" Crabtree said on Monday. \"Alex was never charged and will not have a record.\"\n\nOther hospitals will very likely want to adopt similar policies to prevent police overreach, Crabtree said.\n\nPearce said she was \"appalled\" at the encounter. She added:\n\n\"We are a Level 1 Trauma Center with the only dedicated burn unit in the Mountain West region and we have some of the sickest patients anywhere. Because of this, we work with law enforcement on a regular basis for a variety of reasons and will continue to do so. However, I consider the way in which Alex was treated to be totally unacceptable. No individual in a role of patient care should ever be treated in this fashion.\"\n\nThe new policy \"was written the day after this incident\" and was implemented within weeks, Pearce said. Here's how she described the goals for the change:\n\nAllow front-line patient care staff to focus on their work.\n\nPrevent disputes from taking place inside patient care units.\n\nEnsure only \"highly trained people\" work through such issues.\n\nAs we've reported, Wubbels is a former two-time Olympic skier.\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department says it suspended Payne from its \"blood draw program,\" in which it trains officers to take blood samples. It adds that it updated its policies for officers who remain in the group.\n\nPayne has also been fired from his part-time paramedic job with a private ambulance service.\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake City Tribune, the patient in question was truck driver William Gray — who also works as a reserve police officer in Rigby, Idaho, and whose tractor-trailer collided with a vehicle that was being pursued by police.\n\nCiting Payne's police report, the Tribune describes the highway crash that led to the hospital confrontation:\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"At about 2 p.m. on July 26, Gray was driving a semi north on State Road 89/91 near Sardine Canyon when a man fleeing from the Utah Highway Patrol crashed a pickup truck into him head-on, according to Logan police, who investigated the collision.\n\n\"The crash caused an explosion and fire, Logan police have said. Gray was on fire when he exited the semi. The driver of the pickup truck, Marcos Torres, 26, died at the scene.\"",

Here are some tips for losing weight.\n\nInstead of taking the escalator, consider scaling the building\n\nSave your troughs for special occasions and switch to eating off plates and bowls for most meals\n\nEarning more than $90,000 a year is a great way to start\n\nYou have to try whatever it is Rachel’s doing—she looks fantastic!\n\nMake yourself really earn unhealthy treats by keeping them in a sealed box at the top of a 15-foot greased pole\n\nEat as much cabbage soup as you want, pal\n\nTo become more mindful of how much you’re eating, try breathing between bites\n\nInstead of taking the car for short trips, consider walking, or at least rolling\n\nTry to squeeze into your old wedding dress, tear it a little bit, and then sit and cry with it halfway up your hips\n\nDon’t get discouraged if you slip up with your diet—just start fresh in a year or so",

         "News Articles On ‘Child Suicide Game’ Targeting Vulnerable Parents Share:\n\nVULNERABLE parents as young as 15 are being warned of the dangers of ‘clickbait’ style news articles designed to spread fear and panic around a self-harming game called ‘Momo’, WWN can confirm.\n\nExperts have warned children that the majority of the news articles depict an image of a distorted woman with sensational headlines and can lure parents into a state of panic in a matter of seconds.\n\n“If you see your parent reading such articles please reassure them that everything is going to be okay,” said chief executive of WebSafe Ireland, Thomas Jockey. “Parents may go temporarily insane and start searching through your devices and there may also be a period of time that your YouTube app will be deleted in exchange for the Kids YouTube app, but don’t worry; this is only temporary”.\n\nThe articles, which have now gone more viral than the game they’re covering thus exposing millions of children to something they had never heard of before, feature across all mainstream media platforms and are more or less worded in the same scaremongering style and come with thousands of naive comments from parents.\n\n“I caught my mother searching through my iPad and had to have ‘the talk’ with her,” explains 7-year-old Saoirse Hogan from Lucan, “once you explain that you’re not that stupid as to go harm yourself over a stupid game, then they seem to calm down a bit,” adding, “Sure God bless their cotton socks, if they only knew the real life stuff online we’d be watching, they’d actually have reason to be scared”.",

         "3 Californias? The initiative to break up the state may be on the ballot in November",
         "CNN —\n\nShould the country’s most populous state be split into three separate states? California voters might be able to make that decision this fall.\n\nA local venture capitalist’s proposal to break up California, “CAL 3,” gained nearly double the necessary signatures to get it on the ballot in November, which will allow state voters to decide on the partition.\n\nTim Draper announced Thursday that his initiative had gotten more than 600,000 signatures from registered voters across all of the state’s 58 counties, surpassing the 365,880 signatures required by state law.\n\n“This is an unprecedented show of support on behalf of every corner of California to create three state governments that emphasize representation, responsiveness, reliability and regional identity,” Draper said.\n\nHow could this help California?\n\nAccording to the proposal, first announced in November, this will solve California’s most pressing issues, including the state’s failing school systems, high taxes, deteriorating infrastructure and strained government.\n\nDraper explained that partitioning California into three states would empower regional communities to make better and more sensible decisions for their citizens.\n\n“To create three states from a standing start, you’ll get all the benefits of knowing all the things that worked in the past, and all the things that could work in the future and you get to eliminate all the baggage you got in the state,” Draper said in a news conference Thursday night at Draper University.\n\n“When you get together and you start something fresh, you have a new way to look at it and create better things” he added.\n\nThe 3 smaller states\n\nDraper also suggests that California citizens would be better served by three smaller state governments while preserving the historic boundaries of the various counties, cities and towns.\n\nCalifornia: This will be considered the new state which includes Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey and San Benito counties.\n\nSouthern California: San Diego, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, Mono, Madera, Inyo, Tulare, Fresno, Kings, Kern and Imperial counties.\n\nNorthern California: This would include the Bay Area and the 31 remaining counties north of Sacramento.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nDraper says CAL 3 will deliver the 600,000 signatures to the secretary of state next week and the signatures will then have to be vetted and approved.\n\nCNN reached out to Secretary of State Alex Padilla, but he refused to comment until he receives the signatures.\n\nIf the measure is approved by voters, the governor will transfer the notice of state approval to Congress, which will\n\nvote to ratify the creation of the new three-state structure.\n\nConstitutional lawyer and professor Jonathan Turley told CNN that congressional approval is not impossible, but not likely to happen, as Democrats could feel they have too much to lose.\n\n“Dems consider California to be a single golden empire, it would be hard for them to accept it as three golden empires.”\n\nTurley explained that with the creation of two new states, this would likely add four new members to the US Senate, something that could create endless tensions between representatives.\n\nDraper backed a proposal to turn California into six states in 2014 but it failed to get the required number of signatures to qualify, and the measure was not presented to voters in the 2016 polls.",

         "NIMRUD, IRAQ—Popping open a bottle of champagne and dancing with a mummified corpse in celebration, Smithsonian Institution archeologist Dr. Kathleen Roberts confessed she was “excited as all hell” Thursday after “hitting the mass grave jackpot” in northern Iraq. “Booyah! I mean, seriously, fuck yeah—we’re rolling in bones, baby,” said Roberts, throwing handfuls of Holocene-era rib bones into the air and standing under the confetti-like cascade of osseous chips. “Rang-a-dang, suckers! This is why I got into the business. I mean, you hear about people hitting the burial site lottery like this, but you never think it’s going to happen to you. There must be a 10-foot layer of bones down there! We got warrior bones, kids’ bones, skeletons of virgins tied to stakes. It must have been an absolute bloodbath. Truly horrific. I’m gonna be stinking rich! No more trying to get excited about a body here or a possible sacrifice there. Just goes to show, you gotta keep playing to win though.” Roberts then stripped to her underwear, lustily rubbed her hands together, and dove headfirst into the staggering assemblage of scientifically significant ancient remains.",

         "AMBUSH: Pennsylvania gunman turns gun on self after killing cop and pregnant woman",
         "The gunman who opened fire on two police officers southwest of Pittsburgh, killing one and wounding the other, apparently killed himself in the home where he was hiding out Thursday morning, CBS Pittsburgh reported.\n\nThe gunman, named by local media as Michael Cwiklinski, was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the house in the town of Canonsburg. Police also recovered the body of a woman who was six months pregnant and had a Protection From Abuse order against the suspected killer.\n\nPOLICE SEE HEIGHTENED THREAT OF AMBUSH\n\nState Police Trooper Melinda Bondarenka told reporters that the officers were immediately met with gunfire when they arrived at the scene at about 3:15 a.m. Bonderanka said the police were “ambushed upon their arrival.”\n\nNeighbors told reporters that police were often called to fights at the home where the shooting unfolded.\n\nPSP Tpr. Melinda Bondarenka speaking about two officers shot in Canonsburg pic.twitter.com/bhuxh0SBUV — Megan (@meganguzaTrib) November 10, 2016\n\nCONVICTED FELON WHO KILLED ARIZONA POLICE OFFICER IS SHOT DEAD AFTER STANDOFF\n\nThe officer who died was identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum, according to the CBS report. He died at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe scene was chaotic, according to witnesses.\n\n“It woke me from bed about 3:30, 4 o’clock this morning,” one neighbor told the station. “I could hear what I thought was firecrackers and then I heard somebody say, ‘My partner’s down,’ or something like that. Then, all hell broke loose. I had my porch light on and he came and told us to turn the light off and stay put.”\n\nClasses at nearby schools were delayed or canceled amid the heavy police presence. Homes in the Canonsburg area were evacuated.\n\nLast week, a New York City police sergeant was shot and killed and a second one was wounded in a gunfight on a street with an armed man who had broken into his estranged wife's home.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

A police officer was fatally shot as he sat in his patrol car three days after the bombing.\n\nU.S. District Judge George O’Toole denied the motion for a new trial Friday. O'Toole presided over Tsarnaev's trial.\n\nRelated: When Radicalization Begins at Home\n\nTsarnaev’s attorneys filed the motion for a new trial on July 6. They argued the publicity surrounding the case made it impossible for Tsarnaev to get a fair trial and said he should have been tried somewhere other than Boston.\n\nO’Toole wrote in his opinion that the location mattered little, as the bombings were followed by the nation and the world. “This was not a crime that was unknown outside of Boston,” O’Toole wrote.\n\nThe motion denied Friday is the first round of appeals lawyers for Tsarnaev are expected to file in the case.\n\nCourt documents also filed include an amended order requiring Tsarnaev to pay a total of $101,124,027 in restitution to 49 victims and the Massachusetts Victim Compensation Fund.",

         "Champion’s League Writer Hired To Script Final Game Of Thrones Episodes Share:\n\nAFTER penning the compelling twists and turns of this season’s Champion’s League, the writer of the football epic has been parachuted in at the last minute to rewrite HBO’s Game of Thrones final outings.\n\nHeart-stopping and ingenious outcomes no one saw coming in the Liverpool v Barcelona and Ajax v Spurs episodes have landed largely unknown writer Gary Tindall the chance to craft a satisfying ending for HBO’s popular fantasy.\n\n“If anyone can do it, it’s that lad,” confirmed one TV viewer who cried when watching relatively new Champion’s League character Mauricio Pochettino drop to his knees in tears as Lucas Moura emerged from nowhere to slay Ajax with a hattrick.\n\nTindall first came to the attention of Hollywood after penning the Leicester season of the Premier League and is now taking his flair for white knuckle adrenaline rides with unbelievable outcomes and unlikely heroes to Game of Thrones, hoping to turnaround the mixed reviews season 8 has endured so far.\n\n“A 4-0 to Liverpool? A 96th minute winner and hattrick from Lucas Moura? I would have said that sounded so ridiculous and shit, but somehow he makes it work perfectly. I’m glad he killed off that Ajax plot too, a team made of youngsters beating the rich elites? That’s a step too far,” added another football viewer.\n\nMany people thought the Champion’s League had it best episodes behind it with the Man United v PSG game and the epic battles of Ajax against Real and Juve but with these latest episodes receiving a 9.9 rating on IMDB viewers are excitedly speculating on who will emerge with the crown after June the 1st’s finale.",

         "The inmates at North Carolina’s Hyde Correctional Institution hung three banners from the prison fence last week as supporters gathered outside. One sign asked for better food; another requested parole; the third said, “In solidarity.”\n\nThe protest came in support of a nationwide prisoner strike to call attention to the low inmate wages, decrepit facilities and harsh sentences that organizers say plague prison populations across the country. Though it is unclear how widespread such demonstrations have been, activists said they had shown a new ability to reach inmates across state lines at a time when prison unrest and in-custody deaths are frequently in the news.\n\n“Prisoners aren’t oblivious to their reality,” said Paul Wright, the executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center and a longtime critic of prison conditions. “They see people dying around them. They see the financial exploitation. They see the injustice.”\n\nInmate protests have been happening for generations, but it is only in the last few years that organizers have had success coordinating from penitentiary to penitentiary and state to state. In 2010, Georgia inmates used contraband cellphones to coordinate protests across at least six prisons. And in 2016, prisoners in several states stopped reporting for work to protest their wages.",

There is a slight risk for severe weather from northern Virginia through parts of central New York. The main risk is damaging winds, large hail and brief tornadoes.\n\nAny storm will also have the potential to bring torrential rain, which can cause flash flooding.\n\nSevere storms are possible in the Northeast on Sunday.

         "Jacob Rees-Mogg Rescued After Slipping Through Street Grate Share:\n\nBREXIT champion Jacob Rees-Mogg is recovering with a nice warm bowl of thin, strained mushroom soup following a harrowing four hours spent trapped in a rain gulley after slipping through the bars of a street grate.\n\nThe beloved Conservative had just stepped out of the Houses Of Parliament for his customary Greggs Steak Bake mid-morning snack, when he stopped to wave at a large group of fans and well-wishers who had gathered outside to congratulate him on another productive round of Brexit talks.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Rees-Mogg, by turning slightly to the left to blow kisses at his fanclub he inadvertently made himself narrower than the the grating he was standing on, and vanished out of sight. Emergency crews located the North East Somerset MP in the drains below, and a daring rescue ensued.\n\n“If we’d have lost old Jacob, I’d say this whole Brexit thing would have been ruined beyond repair,” said one relieved member of the rescue team as Rees-Mogg was winched to safety with a spool of thread.\n\n“Great to have him up over the ground again. Now he can go back in there and help to make sure that Brexit is carried off properly, so that we get everything we deserve as a nation without causing any barney or pallaver or knees up for nobody, innit”.\n\nUPDATE: Mister Rees-Mogg has asked us to remove the phrase ‘harrowing’ from our article as it suggests he may be involved with Harrow University; He is an Eton man, and we are not to forget it.",

         "Washington man first to buy legal weed in Spokane is fired after spotted on news",
         "His high was quickly brought low.\n\nA Spokane, Wash. man was fired from his job as a security guard the same day he became the first person to legally buy weed in the city Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t regret it,” Mike Boyer told the Daily News Wednesday. “I’m sad it happened but I got the title: I’m No. 1. I regret nothing.”\n\nBoyer took Tuesday off from his job and set up camp outside Spokane Green Leaf around 7 p.m. Monday. Almost 20 hours later, around 2 p.m. Tuesday, Boyer was first in the door when the pot dispensary opened its doors to sell legal marijuana.\n\n“We don’t line up for Black Friday, we line up for ‘Green Tuesday,'” the 30-year-old told The News. “People camp out for Star Wars and donuts … this is more important than that.”\n\nMike Boyer, 30, featured on newscast as the first person to legally buy weed in Spokane, Wash. Is promptly fired from his job as a security guard after he’s featured on a local newscast.\n\nDressed in sunglasses and a garish tie-dye T-shirt, Boyer yelled, “Go Washington!” as he made his historic purchase.\n\nHe walked out with four grams of Sour Kush and high-fived people waiting in line as he held his bag of weed aloft, yelling “first customer!” as he walked to his car and immediately went home to get high.\n\nMike Boyer, 30, picks out his Sour Kush at a Spokane, Wash. dispensary on Tuesday.\n\nBoyer’s phone buzzed as he took his first few hits: His employer wanted him to come in and take a urine analysis test within 24 hours. A client had seen the security guard on a newscast and was concerned about the drug use, Boyer said.\n\nThe test came back positive for THC, according to Boyer.\n\nBoyer exaults after he makes the first legal weed purchase in Spokane.\n\n“I’ve worked for them on and off for 12 years and several years ago, I signed a document that said I wouldn’t have (THC) in my system,” he said. “I don’t smoke at work!”\n\n“It’s the first day, who’s not gonna run down?” Boyer added. “People who hadn’t smoked since the ’70s and ’80s were coming down just to be there. It was the day of days.”\n\nMike Boyer, 30, is excited as he’s allowed into Green Leaf Spokane.\n\nAfter being fired, the Spokane native posted his resume to Craigslist in the hopes of landing a new gig — hopefully in the marijuana industry, he said.\n\n“I’m staying positive,” Boyer said.\n\nRecreational marijuana was officially sold legally beginning on Tuesday.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?

         "Friend Thinks Her Loser Boyfriend Could Be Friends With Your Boyfriend Share:\n\nIN A BEWILDERING act that defies all basic logic one Waterford friend thinks her boyfriend would somehow be cool enough to be best friends with your boyfriend.\n\nKayla O’Brien (26), who started seeing her boyfriend Ian only a few months ago is under the false impression he’s as ‘gas’, ‘funny’, ‘cool’ and ‘sound’ as your boyfriend.\n\n“Look I’m happy for her, but the hack of her boyfriend, he’s not even the same species as my fella,” you remarked in a bid to soften the blow, and that if anything, Ian was a bit strange to be honest.\n\nAttempting to set up one another’s boyfriends on a play-date is a time honoured tradition among the nation’s girlfriend population, however, it is only ever permissible when it is clear the men share much of the same interests, and roughly resemble one another personality wise, as outlined by experts in this field.\n\n“The imbalance is struck when one woman mistakenly believes her boyfriend can even claim to be the same species as someone else’s far superior boyfriend. This can cause grave offence to the friend; the idea, that her dear friend can look at her amazing boyfriend and think that her pathetic spaghetti-limbed eejit of a man could be considered worthy of his friendship,” explained relationship expert Dr. Herbert Henderson.\n\nThings are expected to get more tense when Kayla reacts poorly to news that your boyfriend ‘is sick’ again and that’s why he hasn’t been able to ‘just meet up for a drink, nothing mad like’ with Ian on any of the last 17 evenings suggested for a double date or play date.\n\n“Oh look at them there, thick as thieves,” Kayla remarked to you the last time the four of you met up together, completely unaware your boyfriend was sending you secret glances which clearly stated ‘don’t make me hang out with this dry shite again’.",

         "‘The Name On My Birth Certificate Is Actually “The ‘Dwayne Johnson’ Rock,” But People Always Get It Mixed Up’: 5 Questions With Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson\n\nDwayne Johnson is unstoppable. From WWE championships to the box office, the wrestler turned actor has dominated every arena in which he’s competed so far, and if the rumors are true, the world of politics may be next. We sat down with Dwayne Johnson to discuss fatherhood, fitness, and his alleged political ambitions.\n\n1. You’ve accomplished so much in your career, yet you’re still working harder than anyone else in Hollywood right now. What’s driven you to succeed over the years?\n\nMy goal was always to become both strong and famous enough that if I were to try to lift Louie Anderson up over my head, people would see us and say, “Look at The Rock picking up that big blond man. That’s nice of him,” instead of, “That pathetic nobody is not strong enough to pick up Louie Anderson.” In order to accomplish this, I first needed to be strong enough to lift Louie Anderson over my head, but I also needed to be famous enough that onlookers would be too distracted by my presence to notice I’m with Emmy-winning comedian and actor Louie Anderson. Suffice it to say, it’s been a long, long road getting to where I am now.\n\n2. How did you come up with the nickname “The Rock”?\n\nMy birth name is actually The Rock, and “Dwayne Johnson” is my nickname. People always mix it up, but I prefer to be called The “Dwayne Johnson” Rock in that order. Both “The” and “Rock” are family names that have been passed down for generations, whereas I just thought that “Dwayne Johnson” sounded right and started going by that when I began wrestling.\n\n3. You were a wrestling champion before you were a film actor. How do you think your wrestling experience has impacted your acting career?\n\nWell, for one thing, I know exactly how thick Hulk Hogan’s neck is. And I think that’s made my acting career much more difficult, because every time a scene calls for me to strangle someone, I automatically widen my hands to the exact girth of Hulk Hogan’s neck. And that’s not always the correct size of neck as described in the script.\n\n4. How long do you plan to stay involved in the Fast & Furious franchise?\n\nAs long as I can. Every day I live in fear of the time when self-driving cars gain the ability to jump a drawbridge, or haul ass backwards down a parking garage at 60 mph. When that day arrives, they won’t need me to star in any more movies. Self-driving cars are killing the Fast & Furious industry. Hell, even Vin Diesel has started taking coding classes so he’ll be ready for when he gets automated out of his job.\n\n5. You’ve dropped a few hints that you might run for president in 2020. What would your message be if you did?\n\nI think that working people in this country are tired. They’re tired of constantly ripping their T-shirts whenever they flex their 20-inch biceps. They’re sick of having to eat 14 pounds of cod per day just to maintain their incredible 4 percent body fat, and I think they’re fed up with a system that doesn’t respect the tremendous work they’ve done recently to define their traps and lats. It’s time for a change.",

         "Researchers No Closer To Understanding What The Fuck You’re Talking About",
         "CAMBRIDGE, MA—Finding themselves increasingly frustrated after years of fruitless analysis, researchers working with a Harvard-coordinated international multi-university research initiative published a report Monday confirming that, despite spending several years and millions of dollars, they have made negligible progress in understanding what the fuck you’re talking about. “Not only are we no closer to understanding what the hell you’re talking about, but evidence also suggests we are further than ever from a solid idea of exactly what the fuck you think you’re talking about. We’re beginning to suspect you may not even know what the fuck you’re talking about, and unfortunately for those charged with cataloguing what the fuck you’re talking about, you simply won’t fucking stop talking,” the report read in part. “Moreover, researchers at Oxford say they ‘have no goddamn idea what you’re on about,’ those from the University of Texas believe you ‘don’t ever stop to smell what shit you’re shoveling,’ and our associates at the University of Michigan have begun simply saying ‘huh?’ when confronted with new data on what the fuck you’re saying. Basically, everyone unfortunate enough to be made aware of you holds the unanimous belief that you should shut the hell up.” In a related report, researchers have confirmed you have absolutely no idea what the fuck you’re doing.",

         "Set Ronan Mullen Free By Registering To Vote In Seanad Elections Share:\n\nNOW is your chance to set Ronan Mullen free by registering for the Seanad elections. If you attended NUI you can register HERE.\n\nSources close but not too close to Mullen have confirmed that he no longer wishes to accept taxpayers money in the form of his €66,940 Seanad salary and if you register HERE by the end of today, the 26th of February, you can set him free by giving him the ultimate gift of voting for someone else.\n\n“I know he looks like he enjoys saying mental health isn’t a real thing, how gay people shouldn’t be allowed to marry and encouraging people to harass women, he considers destined for Hell, as they enter hospitals to obtain an abortion but it takes its toll. Please, set him free,” confirmed one increasingly distant source.\n\nToo proud to outright ask NUI graduates to register HERE and oust him as a Senator, Mullen is facing the possibility of yet more years of consistently opposing things, caging himself in an attritional process which risks eroding away at his very soul.\n\n“Ronan is a beautiful bird, and like all beautiful birds he is desperate to fly. We can help him fly away by voting for someone else in the Seanad elections but if we don’t we’re sentencing Ronan to years of sounding like a terrible human being by asserting women would fake suicidal tendencies just to get an abortion,” added the source.\n\n“You don’t honestly think he wants to do this, do you? It’s just people keep voting him in, you can end his misery by registering HERE,” explained the source, someone how having the ability to highlight a web link to a website.",

         "Hey Bill Nye! Is \"We Are Living in a Computer Simulation\" a Testable Hypothesis?",
         "Sign up for the Smarter Faster newsletter A weekly newsletter featuring the biggest ideas from the smartest people Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\n\nAre we living in a holographic simulation created by a supercomputer beyond our comprehension? That question occurs again and again in science fiction, perhaps most notably in The Matrix, a film in which unreality is so pristine that no one notices the truth. That we are all actually, truly living in such a matrix seems laughable until you consider the advances made by video games in the last few decades.\n\nNot long ago, all we had was pong: two rectangles and a circle. Today we have virtual reality consoles which are edging toward an experience indistinguishable from reality, or at least what we think of as reality. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX cofounder, was recently asked this question: Is it possible that the world as we know it is just a simulation made by someone else?\n\nHis response is perhaps startling, saying that the chances of this reality being a “base” reality are “one in billions.” To make matters even more confusing, humans are increasingly turning to virtual reality devices to escape this “reality.” Thorsten Wiedemann, for example, spent forty-eight hours wearing his Oculus Rift device, proving it is possible to live within a virtual reality at least for a short time.\n\nWhen we asked Bill Nye the Science Guy if he thinks we are living in a computer-generated simulation, he turned to some basic scientific principles to justify his answer. Science ultimately demands testable, repeatable hypotheses to proceed, but how do you test whether we are living in a computer simulation or not? There just doesn’t seem to be a way.\n\nThere is every possibility that this is a hyper-real version of The Sims, and we wouldn’t know. If we had never seen the outside world, there’s no reason we would know it exists, that we’re missing it. So if we as a people had only ever existed in this hyper real video game, we wouldn’t know it was all just a game.\n\nThat is why it is “unknowable,” according to Bill Nye. If we were in a video game, human minds would not be able to detect the outside world until “something goes wrong,” i.e. a glitch in the matrix. Still, Nye wishes luck to anyone wanting to design such an experiment. It might take some time, but perhaps could be done…",

Hoo-Ee, Supper’s On!’ Says Sonny Perdue\n\nBONAIRE, GA—In an effort to summon all 325 million citizens in from the fields for supper time, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue rang the nationwide dinner bell Wednesday evening right at 6 p.m. for y’all to get in here. “Hoo-ee, hoo-ee! Come on in! Get it while it’s hot!” shouted Perdue, making sure to ring it loud enough for all the nation’s citizenry who were playing outside to hear it so they could hurry along now before the food gets cold. “Up, up, up, take your shoes off before you come into your house, and wash those hands real good! I worked hard on this beef for y’all, and I won’t have you waiting until it gets cold. And I better not catch you trying to sneak any of that rhubarb pie before you’ve finished your plate!” At press time, Perdue was scolding tens of millions of Americans for not scrubbing under their nails before coming to the table.",

Julio, 1,230 miles southeast of Hilo, is currently forecast to affect Hawaiian Islands as early as Sunday morning.\n\nIselle, still a Category 1 storm, is about 245 miles southeast of Hilo, moving at 17 mph. It measures 80-mph winds with stronger gusts. Radar imaging shows Iselle's outer bands are near the coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaimea on Hawaii Island experienced a 4.5 magnitude earthquake this morning. At 6:24 a.m. Thursday, the quake shook the island, its epicenter located about 7 miles out from the northern tip of the Big Island.

Kauai County is now under a tropical storm watch. A hurricane warning continues for Hawaii Island.\n\nUPDATE, Aug. 6, 3:20 p.m. HST: Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation before Hurricanes Iselle and Julio make landfall. It includes all islands in the state, activates the Major Disaster Fund for disaster relief, and allows access to emergency resources at state and federal levels. According to the proclamation, the emergency relief period will last through August 15.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaui County Mayor Alan Arakawa declared a state of emergency for the county, which includes Lanai, Molokai, Maui, Kahoolawe and Molokini, effective 11:10 a.m. this morning and extending until September 5, if needed.

As of 7:00 a.m. HST on Wednesday, Iselle was about 695 miles east-southeast of Hilo, moving west-northwest at 15 mph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA tropical storm watch is in effect for Oahu, Maui County (which includes Maui, Lanai and Molokai), and Hawaii Island.\n\n--\n\nHawaii is about to experience two very rare, back-to-back storms.\n\nThe National Weather Service Central Pacific Hurricane Center (NWSCPH) is monitoring two large storms as they approach the Hawaiian islands. Hurricane Iselle is expected to reach Hawaii Island on Thursday afternoon and continue along the island chain through the weekend, and tropical storm Julio is expected to follow along the same path two or three days behind.\n\nIt's being called an extremely rare and unprecedented event. The Weather Channel’s lead meteorologist Kevin Roth wrote that “In 75 years of reliable data you only have one case where [tropical storms] were even 10 days apart,” referring to a time in 1982 when two weaker tropical storms and depressions hit Hawaii.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselle is classified as a category 2 hurricane right now but is expected to weaken into a tropical storm due to cooler waters and increased wind shear around the islands.\n\nBelow, everything we know about these rare tropical storms.\n\nWhere are they headed?\n\nIselle is currently a little less than 970 miles away from main Hawaiian islands, moving westward in the tradewind flow towards Hawaii at 13 mph. Iselle’s center is expected to cross Hawaii's Big Island Thursday night and continue on a trajectory south of (but still affecting) the other main islands, including Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Kauai.\n\nTropical storm Julio, which is trailing Iselle and was 905 miles east of Hilo on the Big Island as of Tuesday evening, is expected to become a hurricane by Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow strong are they and what will happen?\n\nIselle is predicted to remain a hurricane through Wednesday before weakening into a tropical storm, which could have wind speeds between 39 and 73 mph. Iselle is also predicted to have winds in the 45-55 mph range, with gusts as strong as 65 mph or more, especially on mountain ridges.\n\nHawaii's Big Island, where the storms are expected to hit first, was under a tropical storm watch beginning Tuesday evening, which means “tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area within 48 hours.” Because of the warmer water outside the Big Island, Iselle’s speed, which was at 13 mph on Tuesday and is expected to increase, is too fast for the warmth to strengthen Iselle back into a hurricane, Lau said in a press conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA flash flood watch is issued for all islands starting at 4 a.m., Thursday, through 6 a.m., Friday. Otherwise, there are no other watches or warnings related to Iselle, but that could change suddenly and with little notice.\n\nMain threats include heavy rains with area flash flooding and coastal inundations through Friday, with tropical storm-force winds: 45 to 55 mph and gusts of up to 65 mph.\n\n8/5 11a HST: Tropical storm watch has been issued for the Big Island of #Hawaii due to #Iselle http://t.co/hVMu6PTz9D pic.twitter.com/Sbjh3AGO7M — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) August 5, 2014\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are Hawaii residents doing now?\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Tuesday, NWSCPH, which is based in Honolulu, has taken over forecast responsibility for Iselle and Julio from the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\nDrivers are beginning to line up at area gas stations, as well as hit stores such as Costco and Wal-Mart for comestibles and toiletries. Things they’re buying include Spam, toilet paper, bottled water, baby supplies, and rice.\n\nHawaiian Airlines will waive reservation change fees and differences in fares for any customer changing travel plans on August 7 or 8 due to Iselle and Julio, effective immediately. The change must be done by Hawaiian Airlines personnel prior to the departure time of your original flight. There’s some fine print, so click here for more information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLines are crazy at Costco Iwilei right now.

         "Massachusetts Urged to Pass Sports Betting Bill by New Jersey Governor\n\nPublished: June 1, 2022\n\nAuthor: Dustin Williams\n\nLast Updated: February 6, 2025\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has become the latest to have his say on the proposal of introducing online sports betting to the state of Massachusetts.\n\nMurphy’s constituency has long been one of the biggest sports betting states in the US and is now advocating that their neighbours embrace the activity. New Jersey was the first US state to record a monthly betting handle in excess of $1 billion in October 2021 and recorded a handle of $1.120 billion in March 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, the only Massachusetts sportsbooks that are available are classed as top offshore betting sites that you can place wagers on via your mobile phone. When asked about the potential of Massachusetts legalizing state-based sports betting, Murphy was emphatic in his answer.\n\n“I’d do it. We’ve long ago beaten Nevada in terms of the monthly handle, and we’ve stayed high even though New York has now legalized.\n\n“We’ve also been able to attract a lot of jobs into New Jersey because it’s a fintech business … It’s been a home run. I wholeheartedly endorse it.”\n\nPreviously, the Massachusetts Senate and House passed separate sporting bills that disagreed on a number of different topics. The biggest issue was the stance on wagering on college sports — the Senate were against the idea, while the House was in support of college sports wagering.\n\nThis issue could ultimately leave March Madness betting sites and NCAA betting sites out in the cold and leave sports bettors without a significant market to bet on.\n\nOther major differences include the level of tax that they want to charge on retail sports betting. The Senate have agreed on a tax rate of 20% for retail sports betting and 35% for online. The House bill has a lower proposed tax rate of 15% for online and 12.5% for retail.\n\nIt has been projected that sports betting could generate $35 million in tax revenue annually in Massachusetts but the Senate and House will need to come to an agreement on their differences first. Should they agree terms, Governor Charlie Baker can then sign the bill into state law.\n\nBaker himself is an advocate of sports betting and feels they are missing out on tax revenue to bordering states. “There are a lot of people who literally drive over the border just to be able to bet on things like the Super Bowl and March Madness and some of the other big events,” he said.",

         "Washington (dpo) – As part of his plan to improve national security and combat illegal immigration, US President Donald Trump intends to send around 3 million American Indians back to where they came from – India. He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, President Trump described Indians living in the USA as lawless warriors with a history of attacking and killing US citizens. He claimed, “I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.”\n\nPresident Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. “That means they are here illegally. I had to act.”\n\nFurther criticism is to be found on the President’s Twitter account:\n\nHe also tweeted:\n\nThe White House has announced that Indians will be given a three month period in which to leave the country. India is to pay for their flights.\n\nSource:the-postillon.com",

         "\n\n\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Cornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Cornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”\n\nMore…\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is the video referenced above:\n\nSource: http://ncrenegade.com/editorial/target-to-discontinue-sale-of-holy-bible/",

         "News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.\n\nFamily released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”\n\nKirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.\n\nAs an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016.",

         "Take a look at our list below of the best New York sportsbooks that the state has to offer. You can also find our collection of the best New York online casinos here.\n\nSports betting has been on the rise across the US since 2018, and many states have legalized online sports betting since. When looking at sports betting in New York, it’s essential to consider the history of New York’s gambling laws and its stance toward online gambling today.\n\nBettors in New York now have access to hundreds of online sportsbooks, but how do they know which they can use and which are trustworthy and reliable? We evaluated several aspects of these and compiled a list of the best New York online sportsbooks.\n\nOnline Sportsbooks in New York\n\nAlthough retail sports betting is allowed, real money online sportsbooks within the state have only just started being allowed. After the Supreme Court declared the federal law PASPA unconstitutional in 2018, New York opened its first retail sportsbook in 2019. Several more sportsbooks would open in 2019, followed by 2020, when a bill was proposed to allow online sports betting.\n\nAlthough the bill never passed, 2021 brought a more open mindset, with New York Governor Cuomo and lawmakers stating their intent to legalize online sports betting. They opened the floor for application requests from interested sportsbooks and received many requests. It was only in January 2022 that they approved four online sportsbooks to launch their online betting platforms and app in New York. We expect to see more online sportsbooks based in New York become available with how things are moving forward.\n\nOther than sportsbooks operating out of New York, offshore sports book are also available. New York bettors can play at many different offshore licensed sportsbooks, as the gambling laws of New York don’t expressly prohibit the use of offshore sportsbooks.\n\nBetting Options\n\nOne of the first things we look at when looking for the best New York sportsbook is looking at what betting types they offer. We look for the most popular bet types when evaluating online sportsbooks.\n\nMoneyline Betting\n\nOne of the most common and straightforward bets is a money line bet. A money line bet is where you place a wager on who you believe will win the match. The odds are given in the American plus and minus format. The higher the odds, the lower is the individual or team’s chances of winning, while lower odds indicate a higher chance of winning.\n\nThe odds also show bettors what they stand to win when betting on a particular team or player. Plus odds like +115 are assigned to the underdogs and mean that if you bet $100, you will win $115 if your bet is successful. Minus odds like -120 are given to the favorites and indicate if you bet $120, you will win $100 if your bet is successful.\n\nLive Betting\n\nMany bettors struggle to bridge the gap between betting in person at a betting shop or racetrack and betting online. Live betting is the way to overcome that gap and have you betting from the comfort of your home while still feeling like part of the action. Bets can be made in real-time after the cutoff time for pre-match bets has passed.\n\nIt allows you to make bets based on what is happening during the game and is a great time to start making prop bets. The best New York online sportsbooks also offer HD video streaming technology so that bettors can watch the game as it’s happening and make bets related to the current unfolding of events.\n\nPoint Spread\n\nA point spread is like a step up from money line bets, where bookmakers try to average the odds between two teams that are unequal in their ability. If teams initially have vastly different odds like -115 and +120, bookmakers will try to average both teams’ odds to -110 by adding a handicap. This handicap is a margin by which the teams must win or lose for the bet to be successful.\n\nFor example, if the point spread odds for Team A are -8.5 (-110), they are the favorites and thus need to win with an 8.5 or more point lead. The underdogs will have +8.5 (-110) odds, meaning they have to lose with a less than 8.5 point difference or win the game for the bet to be successful.\n\nTotals Bet\n\nAlso called the Over/Under bet, this bet looks at the total points scored during a match. Bookmakers will offer their odds on the game, meaning what they believe the total points/goals will be scored during a game by both teams. Bettors will bet on whether they believe the total points will be over or under this mark. You will usually see bookmakers setting the total score at a half-point mark to ensure a tie can’t happen.\n\nLet’s look at a match with a total score of 9.5 for its odds. By betting under, the total score needs to be less than 9.5, like if the game ended with a 5/4 score, totaling 9. If you bet over, the total score needs to be more than 9.5, like if the match ended 6/5, giving you a total of 11.\n\nFutures Bet\n\nWhile it is a long-term investment, futures bets are some of the most popular bet types. Bettors can bet on almost any event in the future, but they will only receive their winnings at the end of the event or season. Futures bets are also good bets to use when making a parlay bet, as you can add several other bet types supporting your futures bet.\n\nA popular example of a futures bet is when you wager on who you believe will win this season’s Super Bowl. The odds on futures bets tend to change often as time goes by, and it’s influenced by how teams are playing and what is happening in the betting market.\n\nProp Bets\n\nProp bets remain a fan favorite among bettors, as it makes betting that much more exciting. Bettors who make a bet using this type don’t need to worry about which team wins but rather if their wager’s specific conditions are fulfilled.\n\nIt includes bets like which player will score the most goals, how the coin toss will play out, and other such bets. It’s also a popular bet to use when making parlay bets, as it can easily be combined with other bets.\n\nParlay Bets\n\nParlay bets are the riskiest bet type but, as a result, one of the most lucrative ones. In a parlay bet, you make multiple bets, usually between two and ten, on one bet slip. If all your bets are successful, you win the entire bet slip and can receive massive returns. However, if even one of your bets on the bet slip results in a loss, then the whole bet slip is void.\n\nIf bettors bet on a particular team to win the finals of the Super Bowl, then they can use a parlay bet to make that bet even more lucrative. That’s because you know that to win the finals, you also need to win your first match, semi-final match, etc.\n\nNew York Sportsbooks Promotions and Bonuses\n\nWith online sportsbooks come betting bonuses and promotions. The most frequently offered bonus is matched deposit bonuses and free bets, with some sportsbooks offering no deposit bonuses. The welcome bonus is generally one of these three types of bonuses.\n\nA matched deposit bonus means that players will have their deposit matched by the casino between 100% and 500% up to a certain amount. They will receive it as bonus funds or free bet credits that they can use to bet on their favorite sports. If a sportsbook offers a 150% bonus up to $900 on your deposit, then if you deposit $10, you’ll receive an extra $15 and can play with $25 altogether. If you deposit $600, you’ll receive $900 and play with $1500. If you deposit more than $600, you won’t receive the 150% equivalent of the amount but rather the maximum bonus amount of $900.\n\nFree bets are similar to bonus funds in that you can use them to bet, but they’re usually given as bet credits or bet tokens players can use. The free bets will have a specific value set by the sportsbook and can be given either as a match deposit bonus or as a no deposit bonus. A no deposit bonus is a bonus you receive without needing to make a deposit and generally is a lower amount, between $5 and $30.\n\nAll bonuses also have specific requirements attached to them. This can be a minimum deposit amount, rollover requirements, a bonus expiry period, winnings cap, or any other conditions a bettor must fulfill.\n\nBanking at New York Online Sportsbooks\n\nPlaying with real money means many payment methods should be available to New York players. This includes the below popular payment methods.\n\nCredit Cards and Debit Cards\n\nMost online sportsbooks offer Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards, but this deposit method can carry some complications. Due to the UIGEA federal law, some credit card companies don’t allow payments from online gambling service providers, whether legal in the state or not. The payout time for this payment method is generally between three and five days.\n\nPrepaid cards/Play+\n\nOne of the most popular payment methods is the Play+ card, linked to the gambling service providers. You can load money onto this card and then use it to deposit funds on the online sportsbook. You can also use it to withdraw your funds and sometimes even present it for payment at establishments that accept Discover. Prepaid cards like Paysafecard are also an accepted deposit method, but it isn’t always available for withdrawals. If it is, the withdrawal limit is usually set relatively low.\n\nPayPal\n\nArguably the best payment method, PayPal acts as an intermediary between banks, card companies, and gambling service providers. It’s one of the fastest payout methods, generally taking between one and three days. You will also find that PayPal offers low to no transaction fees, making it one of New York bettors’ favorite payment methods. There are plenty of sports bettors that will actively seek out PayPal betting sites to sign up with.\n\nOnline Banking\n\nThis is the go-to withdrawal method if your deposit method isn’t available for withdrawals. Bank transfers and wire transfers are some of the methods that will almost always be offered. However, it is also one of the methods with the longest payout speed, taking between three and seven days.\n\nPayNearMe\n\nIf you don’t want to make an online payment, you can always pop in by certain establishments partnered with online sportsbooks. These are usually shops like 7-Eleven or CVS. You can also go directly to the online sportsbook physical cash cage if they have one. While making deposits and withdrawals this way is fast and easy, you should be aware that a fee usually applies.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is still relatively new to the mainstream but is becoming an increasingly popular option for sports bettors. There are now a number of Bitcoin betting sites available to join, most of which are offshore sites.\n\nHow To Register and Place a Bet\n\nBettors can easily register by following the below steps:\n\nVisit the website or download the app for one of the sportsbooks on our list Click the “Register” or “Join Us” button to sign up Add your personal details like name, address, and contact details Check your available bonuses and their requirements Deposit via your cashier and claim your bonus Start betting on your favorite sport\n\nNew York Sports Leagues Available for Betting\n\nMany different sports/leagues are available to bet on, especially if you use the best New York sportsbook on our recommended list.

         "A woman in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested, charged and convicted after she hit and killed a 7-month-old baby with her car.\n\nMuhuba Mohamed was found guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide after she struck a man who was pushing an infant in a stroller along the side of the road. Mohamed then crashed into a house.\n\nThe man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.\n\nThe baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child’s father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.\n\nA witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.\n\n“Not one of those single things amounts to recklessness,” Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. “But when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.”\n\nMohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.\n\n“If an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,” one Mad World News reader commented on the site’s Facebook page. “She should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I’m sure she won’t get the death penalty.

         "Senator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “unwavering support.”, reports Angry Patriot.\n\nMcCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.\n\nThe Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.\n\nAccording to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both.\n\nMcCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.\n\nEven if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his “unwavering support” to the foreign leader.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason.

         "March Madness is one of the biggest sporting events in the American sports calendar each year. The one-and-done nature of the NCAA Basketball National Championship has made it one of the most interesting sporting events to bet on too, while many will try and pick the perfect bracket for the chance to win huge real money prizes.\n\nEvery year, millions of sports fans hunch over an impossible, hypothetical question: what are the odds of picking March Madness perfect bracket? The answer, of course, isn’t exact; you could fill a hundred brackets with random mascots and still be likely to lose (the less said about this possibility, the better). And yet it’s a question that gets tossed around the water cooler every March.\n\nThe NCAA basketball tournament is upon us, and everyone loves bracket pools. Bracket pools aren’t just for office environments. You can now place a bracket pool on your blog or website. The odds of picking a perfect bracket for the NCAA Tournament are almost one in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the world population is roughly 7 billion people. That means it would take about 3 billion people guessing against each other for 18 million years to figure out a perfect bracket. So let’s take a look at the odds of picking that ideal bracket and what you’ll need to potentially become the next millionaire from winning your office pool at one of a number of sports betting sites that allow you to compete by choosing your bracket.\n\nOdds of Picking the Perfect Bracket\n\nDoes the thought of filling out a bracket for March Madness give you anxiety? As it turns out, the odds are pretty good that you will get at least one game wrong. The odds of picking a March Madness perfect bracket are heavily stacked against you in filling out a perfect bracket for the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nBest teams. Biggest upsets. Most buzzer-beaters. You know it all means one thing: March Madness is here! With college basketball season in full swing, millions of fans are gearing up to fill out their brackets for the big tournament and cash in on that sweet ESPN bonus prize money. But before you go ahead and send your picks in, consider this: how likely is it that you’ll correctly pick the entire bracket?\n\nWhat Are The Odds Of Getting All 63 Games Correct?\n\nThe answer is one in 128 billion. That’s almost two quadrillion times less likely than winning the lottery. It’s not just basketball that has billions of possible outcomes, even last year’s Super Bowl had 256 possible scenarios. You could try your hand at picking every single one of them and you’d still only have a one in 256 chance of success.\n\nWhy does March Madness get so much hype? Because it’s exciting. Even if your bracket does fail, you can watch how other brackets turn out on various sports apps. The thrill of it all is addictive and it gets people talking about you!\n\nThis year’s March Madness bracket is a little different than most. It’s not just about figuring out which team will win each game and making your picks. It’s about getting every single pick correct, the 63 games you have to predict correctly to win the bracket challenge. This seems like far too many games to get right and we figured out the likelihood of actually doing that, it’s 0.01%.\n\nIn short, you’re probably not going to win your office bracket challenge this year. You’re not going to get every single one of these right. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try!\n\nTips to Improve Odds and Win Maximum Games\n\nAs March Madness approaches, your office should be getting increasingly loud as everyone gets into their brackets and starts to argue over who’s going to win and why. But the question that’s on everyone’s mind is, “what are the basic strategies for winning March Madness?”\n\nThe answer is a little complicated because there are so many factors involved. Are you playing in a pool with your friends? Are you in a big office pool? Are you one of the 2% of people picking correctly and will get this done right? Well, here’s what to do:\n\nStudy up on all the teams! Your office pool has spreadsheets for every sport. That spreadsheet will have research on all participating teams. Get familiar with the teams that can go far and those who have a good shot at getting out early. The farther they go, the higher your chances of winning a prize, so study up! Remember: it’s all about strategy.\n\nLearn how scoring works! This is easy enough. You get 1 point for every pick you submit before anyone else does, but then you lose that point if someone else submits that team before you do. So make sure you’re submitting picks early, so you don’t lose them!\n\nPick Against the Highest Seed!\n\nThe most commonly used method is to choose the top seeds. It’s simple and a good strategy, but it doesn’t win. Only about 2% of people who try this strategy win their bracket.\n\nFor any other bracketologists out there, here are some tips to help you win:\n\n1. Choose upsets to succeed but make sure that each upset has a reasonable chance of happening! If you have an upset, that’s too unlikely to happen; it’ll be scored as a loss anyway. Being overly risky will only cause you to lose more points!\n\n2. Learn which teams tend to do well in tournament play and carefully choose them (or their opponents). For example, Villanova has done very well in the tournament lately, so they may be worth picking if you’re going for upsets (but beware, they could lose early).\n\n3. Be prepared for the unexpected! Pick a few teams that you think could beat anyone in this year’s tournament, and pick them at every step of the way. This could be a great way to rack up points if your favorite team makes it far into the tournament or even wins it all!\n\nTop Tips For Betting Right\n\nPick The Team You Think Will Win, Not The One You Want To Win\n\nThis strategy is essential because it helps bettors avoid “picking favorites” or rooting for a particular team based on their geographic location, school mascot, or what color jersey they wear. These types of biases can lead a bettor to overestimate or underestimate a team’s chances of winning based on factors that do not relate directly to how well that team is playing at any given moment. A bettor looking at things objectively will not let bias cloud what they know about each team’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFocus on Strong Teams\n\nWhy focus on teams who finished strong to Win March madness? Historically, teams that finished the regular season strong have won the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe top 5 finishers of each region in the tournament are:\n\nVillanova Wildcats\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies\n\nFlorida State Seminoles\n\nVillanova is a #1 seed and is favored to win the tournament. They finished the season strong. They also have an impressive offense and defense. They have a good mix of sophomores and upperclassmen, which gives them experience and leadership.\n\nKansas is also expected to go deep into the tournament. They have a great offense and defense, however, not as strong as Villanova’s.\n\nCheck RPI\n\nOne of the best measures of each team’s schedule strength is its RPI—the Rating Percentage Index. The RPI is used to rank college basketball teams in the NCAA. It includes:\n\nOpponents’ winning percentage: The winning percentage of the opponents that a team has played, using the most recent data available (e.g., if you’re trying to calculate RPI going into March Madness, you’ll use opponents’ winning percentages from games they’ve played up until that point).\n\nOpponents’ opponents’ winning percentage: The winning percentage of the opponents that a team’s opponents have played, using the most recent data available.\n\nIn other words, how well are those who you play against playing overall? The NCAA considers your schedule to be more challenging based on your RPI.\n\nWhen your favorite basketball team is heading into the Big Dance, you want to be sure it’s got a strong schedule. That’s where the Strength of Schedule (SOS) metric comes in. You should make a full-season projection for all teams and then use those projections to simulate each game of the season thousands of times. SOS simulates the importance of each game in both the overall record and conference record.\n\nYou then take SOS and combine it with power rankings to create an overall ranking. This allows you to compare teams from different conferences. Bettors have been using this method for years and have accurately predicted 11 out of 14 champions.\n\nInnovative Strategies To Win The Pool\n\nMost people have never won their office March Madness pool. They don’t have basketball analytics degrees and aren’t professional gamblers. That said, there are some things you can keep in mind when filling out your bracket to increase your chances of pulling an upset.\n\nFirst, research! Find out what teams have the best high-scoring offenses and look for potential matchups against defenses that struggle to stop opponents from scoring. It’s also a good idea to follow individual players on social media. That way, you’ll get a sense of their personalities and chemistry as a team.\n\nAnother tip is to pay attention to injuries that could affect certain players’ games. While it might seem tempting to pick all No. 1 seeds or all lower seeds, those are harder to win with because the top seeds always win – but if you’re thinking about picking all upsets (which isn’t necessarily a bad strategy), then go for it! The most important thing is that you have fun! Good luck!\n\nIs It Important to Pick Upsets?\n\nMost people fill out a bracket for the NCAA tournament based on their knowledge of the teams and their players, but that’s not the best method. Instead, there’s a better method: picking upsets! When filling out your bracket, you want to pick upsets. Brackets that win are often ones that choose some long-shot teams to win.\n\nIf you want to pick upsets when you fill out your NCAA men’s basketball tournament bracket, here are some tips:\n\nDon’t be afraid to pick the 12-seed over the 5-seed (or vice versa)\n\nUse power rankings to help you make upset picks\n\nPick teams that have been having hot streaks recently\n\nKeep things even by picking an upset in every game (don’t just make one team lose after another team loses)\n\nThere are a lot of upsets that happen in March Madness each year, and if you’re smart about it and know how to choose them, you can have a great shot at winning your pool!\n\nHow do you pick an upset in the first round? These are some tips:\n\n1) A team with a player who has injured themselves during or just after tournament play is more likely to upset a higher seed.\n\n2) If a team has won its first game, they are likely to upset a higher seed.\n\n3) In general, if the score is close at halftime and not by a lot in the end, that’s going to be an upset.\n\n4) If one team has more players on it than another and the smaller team wins, that’s an upset, too.\n\n5) Teams seeded 7th or worse can beat teams seeded better than them, especially if they’re playing against teams from their region with higher seeds.\n\nTips To Fill Your First Bracket\n\nMarch Madness is one of the most widely-viewed sporting events in the world. There are a few tips you should keep in mind for those new to March Madness and filling out their first bracket.\n\nThe first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with the competing teams. You should be able to identify which schools and conferences are involved; look at each team’s win-loss record, and identify any major stories that may have affected a team or coach during the season (for instance, injuries or transfers).\n\nThe second thing you should do is consider what others think of each team. Specifically, you should pay attention to the predictions of sports analysts, sportscasters, and your friends who typically fill out brackets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the age of “bracketology,” March Madness is not just about which team wins, but whether anyone can pick a perfect NCAA tournament bracket. This task seems next to impossible. One look at the odds shows why: 999,964,129 to 1, for every person in the United States.\n\nVarious factors determine what makes a March Madness bracket. The player stats and team records will be the most critical parts of your college basketball bracket. But you can’t forget about injuries, suspensions, previous matchups, and home-court advantage. What’s more, there are also a lot of potential upsets, so try not to pick too many in your final four! Bracketology is as much of an art as science, despite what the numbers say.\n\nThe odds are so insane that the state of mathematical probability ceases to be a factor. Most years, even a McDonald’s fry cook would be better off skipping work and betting everything on his bracket.",

         "During a time when the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, should be working to bring the party together and prepare for the primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he continues to deepen the divide between Republicans and Americans alike.\n\nTrump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.\n\nGraham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.”\n\n“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.”\n\nSenator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson.\n\n“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.”\n\nDonald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.\n\n“I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.\n\n“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. “They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.”\n\nAlthough many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned Trump’s accusations, they continue to support him.",

         "Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress",
         "Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.\n\nReports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”\n\nThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”\n\nStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”\n\nMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.\n\nGoelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”\n\nTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.\n\nWhy was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\n“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\nStrzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",

         "New Law Makes it Illegal to Shower and Do Laundry on Same Day",
         "California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day:\n\nAssembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states.\n\nAccording to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.\n\nWriter Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.\n\nAccording to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.”\n\nSo as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. …\n\nThe new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses.\n\nThis new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers.\n\nEven worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions.\n\nIf the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.\n\nInstead they come up with stupid rules, designed to harm those who can least afford it.\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers' newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources.

         "BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired’",
         "Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.\n\nRelate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\n“Mr. Speaker…You’re fired.”\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that.",

         "Fox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called \"lies\" and \"deception\" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.\n\nOn Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.\n\n\"We're still not clean on this, Chris,\" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. \"Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.\"\n\nSmith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.\n\n\"The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,\" he said. \"And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.\"\n\nThe diatribe left Wallace speechless.\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" he said. \"I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.\"\n\nSmith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.\n\nSmith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as \"not fake news,\" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman",

Read our privacy policy\n\nWith only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.\n\nAs with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.\n\nIt is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.\n\nSo far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\nWhat we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.\n\nHere is who has declined so far:\n\nElton John\n\nopen image in gallery (AFP/Getty Images) ( Getty )\n\nThis rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be \"the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.\"\n\nThat sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: \"Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.\"\n\nJohn added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: \"I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.\n\n\"I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\"\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 100 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 100 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nopen image in gallery ( Getty )\n\nIn early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.\n\nIce T\n\nAn odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.\n\nBut Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.\"\n\nCeline Dion\n\nopen image in gallery\n\nAccording to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.\n\nDion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.\n\nJohn Legend\n\nopen image in gallery\n\nJohn Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.\n\n\"We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\"\n\nAdam Lambert\n\nAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.\n\n\"I don't think I would take money on that one,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks\n\nopen image in gallery Opposition to the Iraq War derailed the career of Texan threesome Dixie Chicks ( Getty )\n\nSpeaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. \"No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,\" he said.\n\n\"If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.\"",

         "In the wake of groundbreaking legislation in Colorado, the sporting world is poised at the threshold of a new era, seeking innovative avenues to integrate the state’s newly legalized cannabis into the fan experience. This forward-thinking approach is emblematic of a broader shift towards the acceptance and commercialization of cannabis within mainstream sectors, including the realm of major sports.\n\nThe Rockies’ Pioneering Initiative\n\nLeading the charge in this unprecedented venture is Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies, who are reportedly setting the stage to incorporate cannabis-infused edibles into their game-day offerings. This initiative, marking a significant departure from traditional concession fare, underscores a willingness to adapt and cater to evolving consumer preferences and legal landscapes.\n\nAt the forefront of the Rockies’ innovative concession lineup stands a quintessential edible that has long been synonymous with cannabis cuisine: the pot brownie. This move, confirmed by insiders within the Rockies organization, signals not just a nod to the changing legalities but a bold embrace of the cultural and culinary potential that legal cannabis holds within the context of sports entertainment.\n\nStrategic Integration and Fan Engagement\n\nThe decision to introduce marijuana-infused brownies at concession stands is more than a novelty; it represents a strategic foray into enhancing the fan experience, aligning with the broader trends of experiential engagement that major sports organizations are increasingly prioritizing. This initiative also reflects a nuanced understanding of the demographic shifts and changing societal attitudes towards cannabis.\n\nThe Rockies’ venture into cannabis-infused concessions navigates a complex web of legal, ethical, and logistical considerations. This pioneering approach is predicated on a rigorous adherence to state laws and regulations surrounding the sale and consumption of cannabis, ensuring a responsible and compliant integration of these products into the public sphere of major league sports.\n\nA Catalyst for Industry-Wide Innovation\n\nThe Rockies’ embrace of cannabis-infused concessions could serve as a catalyst for broader innovation within the sports industry, challenging other organizations to rethink their engagement strategies and concession offerings. This move is indicative of the potential for sports venues to become arenas for not only athletic competition but also for culinary and cultural experimentation.\n\nThe introduction of cannabis edibles at sports events heralds a shift in the consumption habits and cultural norms associated with sporting events. This initiative has the potential to redefine the parameters of the game-day experience, offering fans novel ways to engage with the event and with each other, within the bounds of a legal and regulated framework.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nAs the Colorado Rockies lead the way in integrating cannabis into the sports fan experience, the industry watches with keen interest. This bold step not only reflects the changing landscape of legal cannabis but also sets a precedent for how major sports organizations can innovate and adapt in response to shifting societal norms and legalities.",

         "WE WILL RIOT! Michelle Obama’s Mom Will Receive $160k Every Year Out Of Taxpayers’ Pockets!\n\nThis amount of corruption is a next level thing that we haven’t seen portrayed this nonchalantly before. Namely, Michelle Obama’s mom failed to earn a pension that’s three times the amount of an average American family’s whole income!\n\nIt appears to be that just as Barack, the rest of the Obama’s never intended on getting jobs as us, the regular folks, because they got the chance to live on the backs of honest and hard working Americans that pay taxes.\n\nCongress just announced the most stupid, unexplained and unethical waste of taxpayer money prepared by no other than Obama.\n\nFirst Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will get a big fat check for a lifetime worth 160K government pension when she takes off the White House next year, as concluded by congressional budget statements.\n\nAs concluded in documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson got to be eligible for the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s eight years in office.\n\nMichelle Obama’s mom got to live better than a royalty in the White House, but they are still going to privilege her with $160,000 every year for the rest of her life just for being there her own granddaughters?\n\nHow pathetic excuse is that?\n\nTell us your thoughts in the comment section bellow!",

         "Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.\n\nHave this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe true explanation is much less exciting.\n\nPrior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.",

Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves.\n\nNBC News reports:\n\nThe two black men whose arrest at a Philadelphia Starbucks last month set off a wave of protests against the coffee giant for discrimination have reached a settlement with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday.\n\nThey will each be paid $1.\n\nIn addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.\n\nRobinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners.\n\nGood for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment.\n\n—\n\nPhoto: Getty\n\nRelated\n\nAlso On The Rickey Smiley Morning Show:",

         "Ontario Reports $162m Revenue From First Three Months Of Sports Betting\n\nPublished: September 1, 2022\n\nAuthor: Dustin Williams\n\nLast Updated: September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe launch of sports betting in Ontario, Canada came with plenty of excitement as residents would finally be able to place wagers on their favorite sports teams.\n\nThe sports betting industry fully opened on April 4, giving sports bettors the option to choose between the state-based operators or to continue to use offshore sportsbooks to place their bets online. Those who continued to use the latter will have had an influence on the end results.\n\nDave Briggs, Managing Editor at PlayCanada.com, the first quarter revenue generated stands at $162 million, converting to around US$125 million. Those figures are pretty modest when compared to the more established sports betting regions such as New Jersey ($557 million), Pennsylvania ($521 million) and Michigan ($466 million).\n\nAlthough the first reports were slightly underwhelming to some, Briggs was keen to emphasise the influence of offshore operators and that it is still early days.\n\n“Ontario is at a quarter of comparable jurisdictions when I thought it would be half,” Briggs said. “That would be a good start, a decent start.\n\n“Part of that is, of course, it’s the first three months. They’re just getting started and not everybody is in. I didn’t expect we’d rival any of those (top-three jurisdictions) but we also have an established gambling industry in Ontario and we have 15 million people so it’s not like it’s a brand new market and it’s not small.”\n\nOntario boasts a bigger population than Pennsylvania (13m), Michigan (10m) and New Jersey (9m), but their revenue figures were just 24%, 27% and 22% of those respective states’ numbers. it should be noted, however, that the record-high Ontario Lottery numbers haven’t been included in the report.\n\nThe next report will also feature the months of July, August and September, with the former two being traditionally the quietest months of the year where there is a lack of major sports such as the NFL, NBA and NHL. The return of the NFL season, especially, should have a positive impact on future numbers across the winter.\n\n“You’ll get a kick, for sure,” Baggs added. “But I think you’ll see a definite increase in the third quarter when the NFL is in full swing and we’ll also have the World Series, which is reasonably well bet.\n\n“The fourth (quarter) is that winter period where you’ve got football playoffs and the Super Bowl, which is going to be the biggest one, you’re going to have March Madness, you’re going to have NHL and NBA playoffs.”",

         "No, Sandra Bullock didn't disparage Hillary Clinton",
         "A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going.\n\n\"Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’\" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily.\n\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.\n\nWhile the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.\n\nThe article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her \"new film,\" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.\n\nSign up for PolitiFact texts\n\nAt a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.\n\n\"I don’t agree with that at all,\" Bullock said. \"That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.\"\n\nThe Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.\n\n\"I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,\" she says. \"When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.\"\n\nWe found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton \"if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again.\" We rate this headline Pants on Fire.",

         "Recently when he was asked about President Trump retweeting a couple of videos that made a big fuzz in the media, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) stated that Trump had “been one of the best presidents” he ever served under.\n\nO’Neal stated “I’m not aware of it. I don’t pay much attention to his tweets. I’ll say this for you. He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under.”\n\nAND THE REASONING IS, HE’S NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HE’S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE — THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.”\n\nO’Neal continued, “The president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.”\n\n“He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.” O’Neal added.\n\n“THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.” HE CONCLUDED.\n\nAnd Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:\n\nIf President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations — like he did in the election — and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.\n\nLangone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.\n\nVoters are “fed up,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,” and now want results, he said.\n\nLangone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. “We own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].”\n\n“If you guys don’t get your guys into a room and say ‘Guys this is our moment.’ The American people will throw you out too, the next time,” he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on “Squawk Box.”\n\n“[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever” if he’s able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.\n\n“The American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they don’t want incremental change. They want major change,” said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies\n\nThe Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP’s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.\n\n\n\nMany retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.\n\nBut Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they’re able to “think beyond the next quarter or the next six months.”\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

         "ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail",
         "UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.\n\nBreitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”\n\nAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.\n\nSonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.",

         "Head Of NFL Fines Steeler Teammates $1 MILLION Each!",
         "\n\nBREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem – YouTube\n\nThe hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don’t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?\n\n\n\nAlejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates ‘under the bus’ – YouTube\n\nKim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.\n\nAs I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.\n\nFire chief apologizes for calling Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin ‘n-word’ on Facebook | TribLIVE\n\nChief Paul Smith, who leads Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the Steelers’ decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. “Tomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,” Smith wrote in the post.Cecil’s board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. “The Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,” officials said in a written statement.\n\nSee? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens…they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.\n\nThey can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.\n\nNot One More Dime: NFL Stadiums Have Collected Over $1.1 Billion in Federal Subsidies – Time to Cut Them Off. Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.\n\nAccording to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. It’s time to cut them off. They don’t respect the country. Why should the country respect them?\n\nThe coach of the Steelers sponsored Hillary’s run for President. Note the loot she asked for, show up to see her, you had to pay $330000+. What a rip-off!\n\nPushing this pile of toothpaste back into the tube is impossible now. petition: CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO NFL, PAYING BILLIONS TO LEAGUE. NO MORE . is one example.\n\nNFL gives up tax exempt status – Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat via moving teams around while making demands for freebies like free stadiums, etc. NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers – Jan. 30, 2015 despite being ‘taxed’ lightly.\n\nStadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday’s Super Bowl — to the tune of about $300 million.\n\nAll this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is. But then, the cities are being systematically destroyed…",

         "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month",
         "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nThe latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.\n\nEven though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.\n\nEnrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.\n\nIn Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.\n\nThe USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.\n\nA spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.\n\n“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.\n\nSims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.\n\nThe sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.\n\nBut it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.\n\nThe Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.\n\nOver the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",

         "De Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.\n\nAccording to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.\n\nMoments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.\n\nThe 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.\n\n“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.\n\nThe 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.\n\n“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.\n\nThe state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.",

         "UPDATE: Van Full Of Illegals Caught Voting At Multiple Alabama Polling Locations",
         "The Democrat Party is up to their usual dirty tricks as Republican senate candidate Roy Moore fights against their cheating ways in an effort to become Alabama’s next senator.\n\nAccording to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a “van full of illegals” who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore’s opponent Doug Jones.\n\n“Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. “The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”\n\nMembers of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.\n\nThis is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAll but one of the men were “undocumented” immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.\n\nHow many other dirty tricks will be exposed?",

         "Trump on Revamping the Military: We’re Bringing Back the Draft",
         "COSTA MESA, Ca. - GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”\n\nDonald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.",

         "Dana Rohrabacher Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher making a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich at his Costa Mesa home Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle Rep. Dana Rohrabacher at his Costa Mesa home in August 2017 Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle Rep. Dana Rohrabacher at his Costa Mesa home in August 2017 Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle\n\nCOSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.\n\nThen again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”\n\nHe’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIf you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher explains how he knew when America won the Cold War as he makes peanut butter sandwiches in his Costa Mesa home. Joe Garofoli / San Francisco Chronicle\n\nStanding at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.\n\nIt won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThat’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.\n\nStill, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”\n\nRohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?\n\n“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”\n\n“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOne of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.\n\nRohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.\n\nRohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.\n\n“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.\n\nUnder Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”\n\nThose of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.\n\nMeanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.\n\nPlus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.\n\n“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nRohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.\n\nBut he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.\n\nAnd that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.\n\nJoe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle’s senior political writer.

         "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption\n\nYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.\n\nNew Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.\n\nWhere do these horses come from?\n\nWhile horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.\n\nReuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.\n\nNot-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.\n\nMany of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.\n\nDo keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.\n\nSource used:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>",

         "Massachusetts Urged to Pass Sports Betting Bill by New Jersey Governor\n\nPublished: June 1, 2022\n\nAuthor: Dustin Williams\n\nLast Updated: February 6, 2025\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has become the latest to have his say on the proposal of introducing online sports betting to the state of Massachusetts.\n\nMurphy’s constituency has long been one of the biggest sports betting states in the US and is now advocating that their neighbours embrace the activity. New Jersey was the first US state to record a monthly betting handle in excess of $1 billion in October 2021 and recorded a handle of $1.120 billion in March 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, the only Massachusetts sportsbooks that are available are classed as top offshore betting sites that you can place wagers on via your mobile phone. When asked about the potential of Massachusetts legalizing state-based sports betting, Murphy was emphatic in his answer.\n\n“I’d do it. We’ve long ago beaten Nevada in terms of the monthly handle, and we’ve stayed high even though New York has now legalized.\n\n“We’ve also been able to attract a lot of jobs into New Jersey because it’s a fintech business … It’s been a home run. I wholeheartedly endorse it.”\n\nPreviously, the Massachusetts Senate and House passed separate sporting bills that disagreed on a number of different topics. The biggest issue was the stance on wagering on college sports — the Senate were against the idea, while the House was in support of college sports wagering.\n\nThis issue could ultimately leave March Madness betting sites and NCAA betting sites out in the cold and leave sports bettors without a significant market to bet on.\n\nOther major differences include the level of tax that they want to charge on retail sports betting. The Senate have agreed on a tax rate of 20% for retail sports betting and 35% for online. The House bill has a lower proposed tax rate of 15% for online and 12.5% for retail.\n\nIt has been projected that sports betting could generate $35 million in tax revenue annually in Massachusetts but the Senate and House will need to come to an agreement on their differences first. Should they agree terms, Governor Charlie Baker can then sign the bill into state law.\n\nBaker himself is an advocate of sports betting and feels they are missing out on tax revenue to bordering states. “There are a lot of people who literally drive over the border just to be able to bet on things like the Super Bowl and March Madness and some of the other big events,” he said.",

         "\n\n\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Cornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Cornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”\n\nMore…\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is the video referenced above:\n\nSource: http://ncrenegade.com/editorial/target-to-discontinue-sale-of-holy-bible/",

         "News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.\n\nFamily released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”\n\nKirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.\n\nAs an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016.",

         "Take a look at our list below of the best New York sportsbooks that the state has to offer. You can also find our collection of the best New York online casinos here.\n\nSports betting has been on the rise across the US since 2018, and many states have legalized online sports betting since. When looking at sports betting in New York, it’s essential to consider the history of New York’s gambling laws and its stance toward online gambling today.\n\nBettors in New York now have access to hundreds of online sportsbooks, but how do they know which they can use and which are trustworthy and reliable? We evaluated several aspects of these and compiled a list of the best New York online sportsbooks.\n\nOnline Sportsbooks in New York\n\nAlthough retail sports betting is allowed, real money online sportsbooks within the state have only just started being allowed. After the Supreme Court declared the federal law PASPA unconstitutional in 2018, New York opened its first retail sportsbook in 2019. Several more sportsbooks would open in 2019, followed by 2020, when a bill was proposed to allow online sports betting.\n\nAlthough the bill never passed, 2021 brought a more open mindset, with New York Governor Cuomo and lawmakers stating their intent to legalize online sports betting. They opened the floor for application requests from interested sportsbooks and received many requests. It was only in January 2022 that they approved four online sportsbooks to launch their online betting platforms and app in New York. We expect to see more online sportsbooks based in New York become available with how things are moving forward.\n\nOther than sportsbooks operating out of New York, offshore sports book are also available. New York bettors can play at many different offshore licensed sportsbooks, as the gambling laws of New York don’t expressly prohibit the use of offshore sportsbooks.\n\nBetting Options\n\nOne of the first things we look at when looking for the best New York sportsbook is looking at what betting types they offer. We look for the most popular bet types when evaluating online sportsbooks.\n\nMoneyline Betting\n\nOne of the most common and straightforward bets is a money line bet. A money line bet is where you place a wager on who you believe will win the match. The odds are given in the American plus and minus format. The higher the odds, the lower is the individual or team’s chances of winning, while lower odds indicate a higher chance of winning.\n\nThe odds also show bettors what they stand to win when betting on a particular team or player. Plus odds like +115 are assigned to the underdogs and mean that if you bet $100, you will win $115 if your bet is successful. Minus odds like -120 are given to the favorites and indicate if you bet $120, you will win $100 if your bet is successful.\n\nLive Betting\n\nMany bettors struggle to bridge the gap between betting in person at a betting shop or racetrack and betting online. Live betting is the way to overcome that gap and have you betting from the comfort of your home while still feeling like part of the action. Bets can be made in real-time after the cutoff time for pre-match bets has passed.\n\nIt allows you to make bets based on what is happening during the game and is a great time to start making prop bets. The best New York online sportsbooks also offer HD video streaming technology so that bettors can watch the game as it’s happening and make bets related to the current unfolding of events.\n\nPoint Spread\n\nA point spread is like a step up from money line bets, where bookmakers try to average the odds between two teams that are unequal in their ability. If teams initially have vastly different odds like -115 and +120, bookmakers will try to average both teams’ odds to -110 by adding a handicap. This handicap is a margin by which the teams must win or lose for the bet to be successful.\n\nFor example, if the point spread odds for Team A are -8.5 (-110), they are the favorites and thus need to win with an 8.5 or more point lead. The underdogs will have +8.5 (-110) odds, meaning they have to lose with a less than 8.5 point difference or win the game for the bet to be successful.\n\nTotals Bet\n\nAlso called the Over/Under bet, this bet looks at the total points scored during a match. Bookmakers will offer their odds on the game, meaning what they believe the total points/goals will be scored during a game by both teams. Bettors will bet on whether they believe the total points will be over or under this mark. You will usually see bookmakers setting the total score at a half-point mark to ensure a tie can’t happen.\n\nLet’s look at a match with a total score of 9.5 for its odds. By betting under, the total score needs to be less than 9.5, like if the game ended with a 5/4 score, totaling 9. If you bet over, the total score needs to be more than 9.5, like if the match ended 6/5, giving you a total of 11.\n\nFutures Bet\n\nWhile it is a long-term investment, futures bets are some of the most popular bet types. Bettors can bet on almost any event in the future, but they will only receive their winnings at the end of the event or season. Futures bets are also good bets to use when making a parlay bet, as you can add several other bet types supporting your futures bet.\n\nA popular example of a futures bet is when you wager on who you believe will win this season’s Super Bowl. The odds on futures bets tend to change often as time goes by, and it’s influenced by how teams are playing and what is happening in the betting market.\n\nProp Bets\n\nProp bets remain a fan favorite among bettors, as it makes betting that much more exciting. Bettors who make a bet using this type don’t need to worry about which team wins but rather if their wager’s specific conditions are fulfilled.\n\nIt includes bets like which player will score the most goals, how the coin toss will play out, and other such bets. It’s also a popular bet to use when making parlay bets, as it can easily be combined with other bets.\n\nParlay Bets\n\nParlay bets are the riskiest bet type but, as a result, one of the most lucrative ones. In a parlay bet, you make multiple bets, usually between two and ten, on one bet slip. If all your bets are successful, you win the entire bet slip and can receive massive returns. However, if even one of your bets on the bet slip results in a loss, then the whole bet slip is void.\n\nIf bettors bet on a particular team to win the finals of the Super Bowl, then they can use a parlay bet to make that bet even more lucrative. That’s because you know that to win the finals, you also need to win your first match, semi-final match, etc.\n\nNew York Sportsbooks Promotions and Bonuses\n\nWith online sportsbooks come betting bonuses and promotions. The most frequently offered bonus is matched deposit bonuses and free bets, with some sportsbooks offering no deposit bonuses. The welcome bonus is generally one of these three types of bonuses.\n\nA matched deposit bonus means that players will have their deposit matched by the casino between 100% and 500% up to a certain amount. They will receive it as bonus funds or free bet credits that they can use to bet on their favorite sports. If a sportsbook offers a 150% bonus up to $900 on your deposit, then if you deposit $10, you’ll receive an extra $15 and can play with $25 altogether. If you deposit $600, you’ll receive $900 and play with $1500. If you deposit more than $600, you won’t receive the 150% equivalent of the amount but rather the maximum bonus amount of $900.\n\nFree bets are similar to bonus funds in that you can use them to bet, but they’re usually given as bet credits or bet tokens players can use. The free bets will have a specific value set by the sportsbook and can be given either as a match deposit bonus or as a no deposit bonus. A no deposit bonus is a bonus you receive without needing to make a deposit and generally is a lower amount, between $5 and $30.\n\nAll bonuses also have specific requirements attached to them. This can be a minimum deposit amount, rollover requirements, a bonus expiry period, winnings cap, or any other conditions a bettor must fulfill.\n\nBanking at New York Online Sportsbooks\n\nPlaying with real money means many payment methods should be available to New York players. This includes the below popular payment methods.\n\nCredit Cards and Debit Cards\n\nMost online sportsbooks offer Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards, but this deposit method can carry some complications. Due to the UIGEA federal law, some credit card companies don’t allow payments from online gambling service providers, whether legal in the state or not. The payout time for this payment method is generally between three and five days.\n\nPrepaid cards/Play+\n\nOne of the most popular payment methods is the Play+ card, linked to the gambling service providers. You can load money onto this card and then use it to deposit funds on the online sportsbook. You can also use it to withdraw your funds and sometimes even present it for payment at establishments that accept Discover. Prepaid cards like Paysafecard are also an accepted deposit method, but it isn’t always available for withdrawals. If it is, the withdrawal limit is usually set relatively low.\n\nPayPal\n\nArguably the best payment method, PayPal acts as an intermediary between banks, card companies, and gambling service providers. It’s one of the fastest payout methods, generally taking between one and three days. You will also find that PayPal offers low to no transaction fees, making it one of New York bettors’ favorite payment methods. There are plenty of sports bettors that will actively seek out PayPal betting sites to sign up with.\n\nOnline Banking\n\nThis is the go-to withdrawal method if your deposit method isn’t available for withdrawals. Bank transfers and wire transfers are some of the methods that will almost always be offered. However, it is also one of the methods with the longest payout speed, taking between three and seven days.\n\nPayNearMe\n\nIf you don’t want to make an online payment, you can always pop in by certain establishments partnered with online sportsbooks. These are usually shops like 7-Eleven or CVS. You can also go directly to the online sportsbook physical cash cage if they have one. While making deposits and withdrawals this way is fast and easy, you should be aware that a fee usually applies.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is still relatively new to the mainstream but is becoming an increasingly popular option for sports bettors. There are now a number of Bitcoin betting sites available to join, most of which are offshore sites.\n\nHow To Register and Place a Bet\n\nBettors can easily register by following the below steps:\n\nVisit the website or download the app for one of the sportsbooks on our list Click the “Register” or “Join Us” button to sign up Add your personal details like name, address, and contact details Check your available bonuses and their requirements Deposit via your cashier and claim your bonus Start betting on your favorite sport\n\nNew York Sports Leagues Available for Betting\n\nMany different sports/leagues are available to bet on, especially if you use the best New York sportsbook on our recommended list. Certain bets are not allowed, like betting on college sports if you live in the same state. The top sports bettors love to bet on include:\n\nWe always look for the sportsbooks that offer the most variety in their sports selection, as it allows you to bet on more types. Bettors have the chance to branch out so long as the sportsbook offers more choices than just the most popular sport. This includes offering sports like NASCAR, MMA boxing, etc.\n\nFeatures of the Best New York Sportsbooks\n\nWhile the above points are essential for any New York sportsbook, there are more criteria we use to judge them by. The top three things we look for in all sportsbooks are:\n\nLicensing and Security\n\nCompatibility and user-friendly interface\n\nGood Customer Service\n\nConclusion\n\nNew York is taking steps toward completely legalizing online sports betting, with the first few sportsbooks being legalized at the start of 2022.

         "A woman in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested, charged and convicted after she hit and killed a 7-month-old baby with her car.\n\nMuhuba Mohamed was found guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide after she struck a man who was pushing an infant in a stroller along the side of the road. Mohamed then crashed into a house.\n\nThe man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.\n\nThe baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child’s father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.\n\nA witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.\n\n“Not one of those single things amounts to recklessness,” Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. “But when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.”\n\nMohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.\n\n“If an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,” one Mad World News reader commented on the site’s Facebook page. “She should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I’m sure she won’t get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.”\n\n“Define for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness,” another wrote. “Maybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges. Where is justice? If a Caucasian teenager did this… You finish the sentence.”",

         "Senator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the Australian Ambassador to offer his “unwavering support.”, reports Angry Patriot.\n\nMcCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.\n\nThe Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.\n\nAccording to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both.\n\nMcCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.\n\nEven if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act.

Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason.

         "March Madness is one of the biggest sporting events in the American sports calendar each year. The one-and-done nature of the NCAA Basketball National Championship has made it one of the most interesting sporting events to bet on too, while many will try and pick the perfect bracket for the chance to win huge real money prizes.\n\nEvery year, millions of sports fans hunch over an impossible, hypothetical question: what are the odds of picking March Madness perfect bracket? The answer, of course, isn’t exact; you could fill a hundred brackets with random mascots and still be likely to lose (the less said about this possibility, the better). And yet it’s a question that gets tossed around the water cooler every March.\n\nThe NCAA basketball tournament is upon us, and everyone loves bracket pools. Bracket pools aren’t just for office environments. You can now place a bracket pool on your blog or website. The odds of picking a perfect bracket for the NCAA Tournament are almost one in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the world population is roughly 7 billion people. That means it would take about 3 billion people guessing against each other for 18 million years to figure out a perfect bracket. So let’s take a look at the odds of picking that ideal bracket and what you’ll need to potentially become the next millionaire from winning your office pool at one of a number of sports betting sites that allow you to compete by choosing your bracket.\n\nOdds of Picking the Perfect Bracket\n\nDoes the thought of filling out a bracket for March Madness give you anxiety? As it turns out, the odds are pretty good that you will get at least one game wrong. The odds of picking a March Madness perfect bracket are heavily stacked against you in filling out a perfect bracket for the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nBest teams. Biggest upsets. Most buzzer-beaters. You know it all means one thing: March Madness is here! With college basketball season in full swing, millions of fans are gearing up to fill out their brackets for the big tournament and cash in on that sweet ESPN bonus prize money. But before you go ahead and send your picks in, consider this: how likely is it that you’ll correctly pick the entire bracket?\n\nWhat Are The Odds Of Getting All 63 Games Correct?\n\nThe answer is one in 128 billion. That’s almost two quadrillion times less likely than winning the lottery. It’s not just basketball that has billions of possible outcomes, even last year’s Super Bowl had 256 possible scenarios. You could try your hand at picking every single one of them and you’d still only have a one in 256 chance of success.\n\nWhy does March Madness get so much hype? Because it’s exciting. Even if your bracket does fail, you can watch how other brackets turn out on various sports apps. The thrill of it all is addictive and it gets people talking about you!\n\nThis year’s March Madness bracket is a little different than most. It’s not just about figuring out which team will win each game and making your picks. It’s about getting every single pick correct, the 63 games you have to predict correctly to win the bracket challenge. This seems like far too many games to get right and we figured out the likelihood of actually doing that, it’s 0.01%.\n\nIn short, you’re probably not going to win your office bracket challenge this year. You’re not going to get every single one of these right. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try!\n\nTips to Improve Odds and Win Maximum Games\n\nAs March Madness approaches, your office should be getting increasingly loud as everyone gets into their brackets and starts to argue over who’s going to win and why. But the question that’s on everyone’s mind is, “what are the basic strategies for winning March Madness?”\n\nThe answer is a little complicated because there are so many factors involved. Are you playing in a pool with your friends? Are you in a big office pool? Are you one of the 2% of people picking correctly and will get this done right? Well, here’s what to do:\n\nStudy up on all the teams! Your office pool has spreadsheets for every sport. That spreadsheet will have research on all participating teams. Get familiar with the teams that can go far and those who have a good shot at getting out early. The farther they go, the higher your chances of winning a prize, so study up! Remember: it’s all about strategy.\n\nLearn how scoring works! This is easy enough. You get 1 point for every pick you submit before anyone else does, but then you lose that point if someone else submits that team before you do. So make sure you’re submitting picks early, so you don’t lose them!\n\nPick Against the Highest Seed!\n\nThe most commonly used method is to choose the top seeds. It’s simple and a good strategy, but it doesn’t win. Only about 2% of people who try this strategy win their bracket.\n\nFor any other bracketologists out there, here are some tips to help you win:\n\n1. Choose upsets to succeed but make sure that each upset has a reasonable chance of happening! If you have an upset, that’s too unlikely to happen; it’ll be scored as a loss anyway. Being overly risky will only cause you to lose more points!\n\n2. Learn which teams tend to do well in tournament play and carefully choose them (or their opponents). For example, Villanova has done very well in the tournament lately, so they may be worth picking if you’re going for upsets (but beware, they could lose early).\n\n3. Be prepared for the unexpected! Pick a few teams that you think could beat anyone in this year’s tournament, and pick them at every step of the way. This could be a great way to rack up points if your favorite team makes it far into the tournament or even wins it all!\n\nTop Tips For Betting Right\n\nPick The Team You Think Will Win, Not The One You Want To Win\n\nThis strategy is essential because it helps bettors avoid “picking favorites” or rooting for a particular team based on their geographic location, school mascot, or what color jersey they wear. These types of biases can lead a bettor to overestimate or underestimate a team’s chances of winning based on factors that do not relate directly to how well that team is playing at any given moment. A bettor looking at things objectively will not let bias cloud what they know about each team’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFocus on Strong Teams\n\nWhy focus on teams who finished strong to Win March madness? Historically, teams that finished the regular season strong have won the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe top 5 finishers of each region in the tournament are:\n\nVillanova Wildcats\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies\n\nFlorida State Seminoles\n\nVillanova is a #1 seed and is favored to win the tournament. They finished the season strong. They also have an impressive offense and defense. They have a good mix of sophomores and upperclassmen, which gives them experience and leadership.\n\nKansas is also expected to go deep into the tournament. They have a great offense and defense, however, not as strong as Villanova’s.\n\nCheck RPI\n\nOne of the best measures of each team’s schedule strength is its RPI—the Rating Percentage Index. The RPI is used to rank college basketball teams in the NCAA. It includes:\n\nOpponents’ winning percentage: The winning percentage of the opponents that a team has played, using the most recent data available (e.g., if you’re trying to calculate RPI going into March Madness, you’ll use opponents’ winning percentages from games they’ve played up until that point).\n\nOpponents’ opponents’ winning percentage: The winning percentage of the opponents that a team’s opponents have played, using the most recent data available.\n\nIn other words, how well are those who you play against playing overall? The NCAA considers your schedule to be more challenging based on your RPI.\n\nWhen your favorite basketball team is heading into the Big Dance, you want to be sure it’s got a strong schedule. That’s where the Strength of Schedule (SOS) metric comes in. You should make a full-season projection for all teams and then use those projections to simulate each game of the season thousands of times. SOS simulates the importance of each game in both the overall record and conference record.\n\nYou then take SOS and combine it with power rankings to create an overall ranking. This allows you to compare teams from different conferences. Bettors have been using this method for years and have accurately predicted 11 out of 14 champions.\n\nInnovative Strategies To Win The Pool\n\nMost people have never won their office March Madness pool. They don’t have basketball analytics degrees and aren’t professional gamblers. That said, there are some things you can keep in mind when filling out your bracket to increase your chances of pulling an upset.\n\nFirst, research! Find out what teams have the best high-scoring offenses and look for potential matchups against defenses that struggle to stop opponents from scoring. It’s also a good idea to follow individual players on social media. That way, you’ll get a sense of their personalities and chemistry as a team.\n\nAnother tip is to pay attention to injuries that could affect certain players’ games. While it might seem tempting to pick all No. 1 seeds or all lower seeds, those are harder to win with because the top seeds always win – but if you’re thinking about picking all upsets (which isn’t necessarily a bad strategy), then go for it! The most important thing is that you have fun! Good luck!\n\nIs It Important to Pick Upsets?\n\nMost people fill out a bracket for the NCAA tournament based on their knowledge of the teams and their players, but that’s not the best method. Instead, there’s a better method: picking upsets! When filling out your bracket, you want to pick upsets. Brackets that win are often ones that choose some long-shot teams to win.\n\nIf you want to pick upsets when you fill out your NCAA men’s basketball tournament bracket, here are some tips:\n\nDon’t be afraid to pick the 12-seed over the 5-seed (or vice versa)\n\nUse power rankings to help you make upset picks\n\nPick teams that have been having hot streaks recently\n\nKeep things even by picking an upset in every game (don’t just make one team lose after another team loses)\n\nThere are a lot of upsets that happen in March Madness each year, and if you’re smart about it and know how to choose them, you can have a great shot at winning your pool!\n\nHow do you pick an upset in the first round? These are some tips:\n\n1) A team with a player who has injured themselves during or just after tournament play is more likely to upset a higher seed.\n\n2) If a team has won its first game, they are likely to upset a higher seed.\n\n3) In general, if the score is close at halftime and not by a lot in the end, that’s going to be an upset.\n\n4) If one team has more players on it than another and the smaller team wins, that’s an upset, too.\n\n5) Teams seeded 7th or worse can beat teams seeded better than them, especially if they’re playing against teams from their region with higher seeds.\n\nTips To Fill Your First Bracket\n\nMarch Madness is one of the most widely-viewed sporting events in the world. There are a few tips you should keep in mind for those new to March Madness and filling out their first bracket.\n\nThe first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with the competing teams. You should be able to identify which schools and conferences are involved; look at each team’s win-loss record, and identify any major stories that may have affected a team or coach during the season (for instance, injuries or transfers).\n\nThe second thing you should do is consider what others think of each team. Specifically, you should pay attention to the predictions of sports analysts, sportscasters, and your friends who typically fill out brackets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the age of “bracketology,” March Madness is not just about which team wins, but whether anyone can pick a perfect NCAA tournament bracket. This task seems next to impossible. One look at the odds shows why: 999,964,129 to 1, for every person in the United States.\n\nVarious factors determine what makes a March Madness bracket. The player stats and team records will be the most critical parts of your college basketball bracket. But you can’t forget about injuries, suspensions, previous matchups, and home-court advantage. What’s more, there are also a lot of potential upsets, so try not to pick too many in your final four! Bracketology is as much of an art as science, despite what the numbers say.\n\nThe odds are so insane that the state of mathematical probability ceases to be a factor. Most years, even a McDonald’s fry cook would be better off skipping work and betting everything on his bracket.",

         "Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress",
         "Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.\n\nReports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”\n\nThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”\n\nStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”\n\nMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.\n\nGoelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”\n\nTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.\n\nWhy was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\n“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\nStrzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.",

         "New Law Makes it Illegal to Shower and Do Laundry on Same Day",
         "California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day:\n\nAssembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states.\n\nAccording to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.\n\nWriter Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.\n\nAccording to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.”\n\nSo as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. …\n\nThe new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses.\n\nThis new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers.\n\nEven worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions.\n\nIf the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.\n\nInstead they come up with stupid rules, designed to harm those who can least afford it.\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers' newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources. When you share to your friends, however, you greatly help distribute our content. Please take a moment and consider sharing this article with your friends and family. Thank you.",

         "BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired’",
         "Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.\n\nRelate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\n“Mr. Speaker…You’re fired.”\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that.",

         "Fox News host Shepard Smith slammed what he called \"lies\" and \"deception\" pushed by Donald Trump Jr. in a fiery Friday rant over emerging details of Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer.\n\nOn Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.\n\n\"We're still not clean on this, Chris,\" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. \"Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.\"\n\nSmith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.\n\n\"The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,\" he said. \"And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.\"\n\nThe diatribe left Wallace speechless.\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" he said. \"I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.\"\n\nSmith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.\n\nSmith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as \"not fake news,\" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman",

Read our privacy policy\n\nWith only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.\n\nAs with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.\n\nIt is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.\n\nSo far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\nWhat we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.\n\nHere is who has declined so far:\n\nElton John\n\nopen image in gallery (AFP/Getty Images) ( Getty )\n\nThis rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be \"the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.\"\n\nThat sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: \"Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.\"\n\nJohn added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: \"I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.\n\n\"I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\"\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 100 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 100 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nopen image in gallery ( Getty )\n\nIn early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.\n\nIce T\n\nAn odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.\n\nBut Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.\"\n\nCeline Dion\n\nopen image in gallery\n\nAccording to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.\n\nDion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.\n\nJohn Legend\n\nopen image in gallery\n\nJohn Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.\n\n\"We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\"\n\nAdam Lambert\n\nAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.\n\n\"I don't think I would take money on that one,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks\n\nopen image in gallery Opposition to the Iraq War derailed the career of Texan threesome Dixie Chicks ( Getty )\n\nSpeaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. \"No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,\" he said.\n\n\"If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.\"",

         "In the wake of groundbreaking legislation in Colorado, the sporting world is poised at the threshold of a new era, seeking innovative avenues to integrate the state’s newly legalized cannabis into the fan experience. This forward-thinking approach is emblematic of a broader shift towards the acceptance and commercialization of cannabis within mainstream sectors, including the realm of major sports.\n\nThe Rockies’ Pioneering Initiative\n\nLeading the charge in this unprecedented venture is Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies, who are reportedly setting the stage to incorporate cannabis-infused edibles into their game-day offerings. This initiative, marking a significant departure from traditional concession fare, underscores a willingness to adapt and cater to evolving consumer preferences and legal landscapes.\n\nAt the forefront of the Rockies’ innovative concession lineup stands a quintessential edible that has long been synonymous with cannabis cuisine: the pot brownie. This move, confirmed by insiders within the Rockies organization, signals not just a nod to the changing legalities but a bold embrace of the cultural and culinary potential that legal cannabis holds within the context of sports entertainment.\n\nStrategic Integration and Fan Engagement\n\nThe decision to introduce marijuana-infused brownies at concession stands is more than a novelty; it represents a strategic foray into enhancing the fan experience, aligning with the broader trends of experiential engagement that major sports organizations are increasingly prioritizing. This initiative also reflects a nuanced understanding of the demographic shifts and changing societal attitudes towards cannabis.\n\nThe Rockies’ venture into cannabis-infused concessions navigates a complex web of legal, ethical, and logistical considerations. This pioneering approach is predicated on a rigorous adherence to state laws and regulations surrounding the sale and consumption of cannabis, ensuring a responsible and compliant integration of these products into the public sphere of major league sports.\n\nA Catalyst for Industry-Wide Innovation\n\nThe Rockies’ embrace of cannabis-infused concessions could serve as a catalyst for broader innovation within the sports industry, challenging other organizations to rethink their engagement strategies and concession offerings. This move is indicative of the potential for sports venues to become arenas for not only athletic competition but also for culinary and cultural experimentation.\n\nThe introduction of cannabis edibles at sports events heralds a shift in the consumption habits and cultural norms associated with sporting events. This initiative has the potential to redefine the parameters of the game-day experience, offering fans novel ways to engage with the event and with each other, within the bounds of a legal and regulated framework.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nAs the Colorado Rockies lead the way in integrating cannabis into the sports fan experience, the industry watches with keen interest. This bold step not only reflects the changing landscape of legal cannabis but also sets a precedent for how major sports organizations can innovate and adapt in response to shifting societal norms and legalities.",

         "Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.\n\nHave this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe true explanation is much less exciting.\n\nPrior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.",

         "Ontario Reports $162m Revenue From First Three Months Of Sports Betting\n\nPublished: September 1, 2022\n\nAuthor: Dustin Williams\n\nLast Updated: September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe launch of sports betting in Ontario, Canada came with plenty of excitement as residents would finally be able to place wagers on their favorite sports teams.\n\nThe sports betting industry fully opened on April 4, giving sports bettors the option to choose between the state-based operators or to continue to use offshore sportsbooks to place their bets online. Those who continued to use the latter will have had an influence on the end results.\n\nDave Briggs, Managing Editor at PlayCanada.com, the first quarter revenue generated stands at $162 million, converting to around US$125 million. Those figures are pretty modest when compared to the more established sports betting regions such as New Jersey ($557 million), Pennsylvania ($521 million) and Michigan ($466 million).\n\nAlthough the first reports were slightly underwhelming to some, Briggs was keen to emphasise the influence of offshore operators and that it is still early days.\n\n“Ontario is at a quarter of comparable jurisdictions when I thought it would be half,” Briggs said. “That would be a good start, a decent start.\n\n“Part of that is, of course, it’s the first three months. They’re just getting started and not everybody is in. I didn’t expect we’d rival any of those (top-three jurisdictions) but we also have an established gambling industry in Ontario and we have 15 million people so it’s not like it’s a brand new market and it’s not small.”\n\nOntario boasts a bigger population than Pennsylvania (13m), Michigan (10m) and New Jersey (9m), but their revenue figures were just 24%, 27% and 22% of those respective states’ numbers. it should be noted, however, that the record-high Ontario Lottery numbers haven’t been included in the report.\n\nThe next report will also feature the months of July, August and September, with the former two being traditionally the quietest months of the year where there is a lack of major sports such as the NFL, NBA and NHL. The return of the NFL season, especially, should have a positive impact on future numbers across the winter.\n\n“You’ll get a kick, for sure,” Baggs added. “But I think you’ll see a definite increase in the third quarter when the NFL is in full swing and we’ll also have the World Series, which is reasonably well bet.\n\n“The fourth (quarter) is that winter period where you’ve got football playoffs and the Super Bowl, which is going to be the biggest one, you’re going to have March Madness, you’re going to have NHL and NBA playoffs.”",

         "A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going.\n\n\"Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’\" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily.\n\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.\n\nWhile the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.\n\nThe article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her \"new film,\" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.\n\nSign up for PolitiFact texts\n\nAt a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.\n\n\"I don’t agree with that at all,\" Bullock said. \"That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.\"\n\nThe Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.\n\n\"I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,\" she says. \"When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.\"\n\nWe found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton \"if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again.\" We rate this headline Pants on Fire.",

         "ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail",
         "UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.\n\nBreitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”\n\nAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.\n\nSonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.",

         "Head Of NFL Fines Steeler Teammates $1 MILLION Each!",
         "\n\nBREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem – YouTube\n\nThe hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don’t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?\n\n\n\nAlejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates ‘under the bus’ – YouTube\n\nKim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.\n\nAs I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.\n\nFire chief apologizes for calling Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin ‘n-word’ on Facebook | TribLIVE\n\nChief Paul Smith, who leads Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the Steelers’ decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. “Tomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,” Smith wrote in the post.Cecil’s board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. “The Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,” officials said in a written statement.\n\nSee? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens…they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.\n\nThey can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.\n\nNot One More Dime: NFL Stadiums Have Collected Over $1.1 Billion in Federal Subsidies – Time to Cut Them Off. Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.\n\nAccording to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. It’s time to cut them off. They don’t respect the country. Why should the country respect them?\n\nThe coach of the Steelers sponsored Hillary’s run for President. Note the loot she asked for, show up to see her, you had to pay $330000+. What a rip-off!\n\nPushing this pile of toothpaste back into the tube is impossible now. petition: CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO NFL, PAYING BILLIONS TO LEAGUE. NO MORE . is one example.\n\nNFL gives up tax exempt status – Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat via moving teams around while making demands for freebies like free stadiums, etc. NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers – Jan. 30, 2015 despite being ‘taxed’ lightly.\n\nStadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday’s Super Bowl — to the tune of about $300 million.\n\nAll this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is. But then, the cities are being systematically destroyed…",

         "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nThe latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.\n\nEven though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.\n\nEnrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.\n\nIn Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.\n\nThe USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.\n\nA spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.\n\n“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.\n\nSims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.\n\nThe sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.\n\nBut it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.\n\nThe Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.\n\nOver the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",

         "De Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.\n\nAccording to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.\n\nMoments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.\n\nThe 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.\n\n“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.\n\nThe 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.\n\n“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.\n\nThe state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.",

         "The Democrat Party is up to their usual dirty tricks as Republican senate candidate Roy Moore fights against their cheating ways in an effort to become Alabama’s next senator.\n\nAccording to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a “van full of illegals” who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore’s opponent Doug Jones.\n\n“Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. “The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”\n\nMembers of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.\n\nThis is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAll but one of the men were “undocumented” immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.\n\nHow many other dirty tricks will be exposed?",

         "COSTA MESA, Ca. - GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”\n\nDonald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.",

         "Dana Rohrabacher Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher making a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich at his Costa Mesa home Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle Rep. Dana Rohrabacher at his Costa Mesa home in August 2017 Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle Rep. Dana Rohrabacher at his Costa Mesa home in August 2017 Joe Garofoli/San Francisco Chronicle\n\nCOSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.\n\nThen again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”\n\nHe’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIf you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher explains how he knew when America won the Cold War as he makes peanut butter sandwiches in his Costa Mesa home. Joe Garofoli / San Francisco Chronicle\n\nStanding at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.\n\nIt won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThat’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.\n\nStill, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”\n\nRohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?\n\n“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”\n\n“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOne of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.\n\nRohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.\n\nRohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.\n\n“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.\n\nUnder Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”\n\nThose of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.\n\nMeanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.\n\nPlus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.\n\n“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nRohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.\n\nBut he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.\n\nAnd that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.\n\nJoe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle’s senior political writer.

         "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption\n\nYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.\n\nNew Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.\n\nWhere do these horses come from?\n\nWhile horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.\n\nReuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.\n\nNot-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.\n\nMany of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.\n\nDo keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.\n\nSource used:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nSubmit a correction >>",

The 34 percent “retaliatory tariff” that the Trump administration recently imposed on the Chinese was on top of a 20 percent tariff that the Trump administration had already imposed on them.

         "Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents",
         "Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents\n\nAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.\n\nThe allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.\n\nThis shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.\n\nHowever, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.\n\nIt was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.\n\nIt may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\n\n“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”\n\nWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”\n\nNSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”\n\nThe Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.\n\nYou are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns.",

         "Photo by Shardar Tarikul Islam on Unsplash\n\n\n\nFollowing the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.\n\nMead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.\n\n“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”\n\nMr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.\n\n“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”\n\nMr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.\n\n“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”\n\nNo wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.
